"Trump's campaign dwarfed by Clinton's By Kenneth Vogel and Isaac Arnsdorf 05/21/2016 12:25 AM EDT At the outset of the general election, Hillary Clinton's campaign looks like a well-oiled juggernaut next to Donald Trump's vastly smaller, self-funded operation, a POLITICO analysis of Federal Election Commission reports filed Friday Through the end of last month, the period covered by the most recent FEC filings, Trump's campaign had spent less than a third as much Clinton's ($57 million to $182 million) and had assembled a staff about one-tenth the size of her (70 employees to 732), with a fraction as many offices (Trump last month paid $101,000 in rent $328,000 for Clinton), the analysis Trump - a billionaire rookie candidate whose own money had accounted for 75 percent of the $59 million brought in by his campaign - is moving quickly to buttress his campaign operations, partly by launching a fundraising and field operation in coordination with the Republican National He did little to assemble the trappings of a traditional campaign during a chaotic primary during which he dispatched 17 rivals for the Republican presidential nomination, many of whom ran more traditional, and expensive, The $57 million Trump had spent through the end of April is only slightly more than the $54 million spent by Florida Marco Rubio, who dropped out of the race more than two months ago, and it's far less than the $81 million spent by Ted The Texas senator assembled a sophisticated micro-targeting machine that helped keep in the race until he dropped out this month, after being trounced by Trump in the Indiana Last month, as Trump was struggling to put away Cruz, Trump's campaign spent $ million on advertising, while Clinton spent $12 million on digital and broadcast media buys, as she worked to put away her rival for the Democratic nomination Vermont Bernie Yet Clinton's campaign appeared to be preparing for the general election, spending far less than Sanders, whose $207 million in total spending marks him as the cycle's biggest He continued spending briskly in April, dropping $ million, as compared to $ million for Sanders spent almost twice as much as Clinton on media and payroll (despite a slightly smaller staff), as well as more on online advertising and direct As a result, Sanders entered this month with only $ million in the bank, compared to Clinton's $30 Additionally, unlike either Sanders or Trump, both of whom have eschewed super PACs, Clinton is backed by the deep-pocketed Priorities USA It raised $ million last month, more than a third of which came from Univision chairman Haim Saban and his wife, Cheryl, according to its FEC report, which showed it finished last month with $47 million in the A handful of super PACs are vying to raise big money for Trump, but they have gotten off to a slow start, as they've struggled with And Clinton also has a massive head start over Trump when it come to analytics, polling and building models of likely voters and turnout Trump, who only recently hired a pollster, still had not spent a dime on polling through the end of last month, while Clinton spent $896,000 in April Trump did start beefing up other areas of his operation last month, his FEC report For instance, he spent $931,000 on direct mail, as compared to only $398,000 spent by Clinton, according to her And Trump continued to be among the biggest spenders in field on branded merchandise, including his signature Make America Great Again His campaign last month spent $856,000 on hats, t-shirts, mugs and stickers, versus the $88,000 Clinton spent on To view online: To change your alert settings, please go to or email was sent to user@domain by: POLITICO, LLC 1000 Wilson Arlington, VA, 22209, USA To unsubscribe,",0
"Hi Ricardo - good to hear from Thanks too for the interesting I have some comments on this section ( ) and also for the others' you're helping to Regarding - I hope Dick and Keith will have jump in to help you lead, and I can I think the hardest, yet most important part, is to boil the section down to In looking over your good outline, sent back on 17 (my delay is due to fatherdom just after this time), you cover The trick may be to decide on the main message and use that to guid what's included and what is left For the IPCC, we need to know what is relevant and useful for assessing recent and future climate Moreover, we have to have solid data - not inconclusive My take: ENSO - coral records sensitive to ENSO ( , Urban et and Cobb et al - attached) suggest ENSO has changed in response to past forcing change (Cobb et al - updated interp by mann et al - see recent email attachment) and recent climate change (Urban et al). Ditto for Indian Ocean - not sure if can connect to dipole - I could ask Julie Cole? NAO - lots of papers and what's the consensus? I'm not sure, but I think it is that we can't say for sure what has happend to the NAO - or AO for sure (Keith might no more - recent Ed Cook paper might be the key? - I'm not an expert here). Same thing for PDO (not an expert, but aren't their recons that don't agree - see cole et al for one- attached). In both these cases, the recons don't always Or do they say the NAO variability has stayed pretty constant? Tropical Atlantic - Black et al 1999 (attached to prev email) also says 12year mode (no consensus if diapole is the correct name for what Chang first described - see ref in Black attached) has been constant for 800 Annual modes - does paleo have anything definitive to say yet? I'm a coauthor on a soon to be submitted AO recon paper, but I'm not sure reviewers will go for it - nor does it match D'Arrigo's recent AO recon paper (can't find). So, the trick is for you to lead us (Dick, Keith, me - maybe Julie - ENSO expert) to produce pages of HIGHLY focused and relevant Can you take another crack at your outline and then tell us what you need? Thanks! Regarding - can you help Dan, Ramesh and others to make quick headway on this one - it's totally Thanks! Regarding - Keith will need help, no doubt - particularly with a good Hemisphere perspective (he can override me on this, but since I'm contacting ) thanks! What do we have for the southern hem?

Nope, actually, it hasn' Today, the Texas senator left the door open, ever so slightly, that he would challenge DONALD TRUMP at the In an interview with Glenn Beck, Cruz was asked if he would revive his challenge if he won Nebraska's Republican primary He laughed and didn't really say ""Well, I am not holding my My assumption is that that will not happen,"" he ""But listen, let's be very clear: If there is a path to victory, we launched this campaign intending to "" Though later he did rule out a third party But the soundbite of the day did not belong to Ted in the Cruz His wife, Heidi Cruz, compared the end of her husband's presidential campaign to the protracted fight to end The Texas Tribune reports Heidi Cruz did so while talking on a conference call with the campaign's National Prayer 5) RYAN REDUX: Paul Ryan and DONALD TRUMP's staredown POLITICO's Rachael Bade looks at what Ryan's departure from the Republican convention could Spoiler Alert: Perhaps in hope of avoiding such a fate, Ryan laid out his meeting schedule with Trump for Another sort-of olive branch from Ryan: He called on conservatives to unite and defeat HILLARY Ryan told The Wall Street Journal he still had issues to work out with Trump but that what he wanted to see, ultimately, was a unified conservative front: ""What I want to see is all conservatives rally together to win this election and defeat Hillary "" TRAIL MIX: Elsewhere on the campaign trail, the troops prefer DONALD TRUMP but many would prefer none of the Peter Thiel hits the like Nickelback outpolls HILLARY CLINTON lurches to the left and JOE BIDEN is COMMAND PERFORMANCE: A survey of troops finds they prefer DONALD TRUMP by a 2-1 margin over HILLARY CLINTON, though one in five say they'd rather not vote if those were their (Military Times) RESERVED RUBIO: Gotta hand it to him: MARCO RUBIO is He still has the same reservations about DONALD TRUMP he But he'll still vote for Just as he SEND ME AN ANGEL (INVESTOR): Peter Thiel, the Libertarian-minded, super rich Silicon Valley venture capitalist, is a DONALD TRUMP (The Verge) LOOK AT THIS POLLING GRAPH: Every time it makes me laugh: Mother Jones gleefully notes a survey that pegs DONALD TRUMP as less popular than head lice and Canadian rock poseurs BLAST NOTE: Mother Jones, this is how you remind me of what you really HILLARYCARE: The New York Times reports HILLARY CLINTON is ""lurching to the left"" on health care as she looks to see off BERNIE PET PROJECTS: Washington Post looks at HILLARY CLINTON's animal policy, one of 31 policy planks on her web This one has some, uh, some bite: JOE KNOWS: Vice President JOE BIDEN says he's confident HILLARY CLINTON will be the Democratic LADIES FIGHT: Correct the Record, an outside group backing HILLARY CLINTON, has a new ad targeting DONALD TRUMP on women's WHAT'S NEXT: Democrats turn their attention to an array of states voting on June 7, including California (where BERNIE SANDERS rallies in Stockton, , today) and South Dakota (where Sanders is headed on Thursday).

"Mike Here are some of the issues as I see them: Saying it is natural variability is not an What are the physical processes? Where did the heat go? We know there is a build up of ocean heat prior to El Nino, and a discharge (and sfc T warming) during late stages of El Nino, but is the observing system sufficient to track it? Quite aside from the changes in the ocean, we know there are major changes in the storm tracks and teleconnections with ENSO, and there is a LOT more rain on land during La Nina (more drought in El Nino), so how does the albedo change overall (changes in cloud)? At the very least the extra rain on land means a lot more heat goes into evaporation rather than raising temperatures, and so that keeps land temps down: and should generate But the resulting evaporative cooling means the heat goes into atmosphere and should be radiated to space: so we should be able to track it with CERES The CERES data are unfortunately wonting and so too are the cloud The ocean data are also lacking although some of that may be related to the ocean current changes and burying heat at depth where it is not picked If it is sequestered at depth then it comes back to haunt us later and so we should know about Kevin",0

"Hi Ed, Just to reiterate one more key point---Superimposing the two series and their uncertainties is not the whole story (although it is a definite improvement over just showing the two reconstructions on top of each other w/ know assessment of uncertainty). However, doing the above still only poses the question: apple +/- [uncertainty in apple] ? orange +/- [uncertainty in orange] As we discussed in a previous email exchange (based on the correlations you calculated between instrumental series w/ the trend removed) , the two reconstructions should probably only share about 60% or so variance in common in the best case scenario, where there is no uncertainty at all, owing simply to the differing target So we need to be very careful w/ the following statement which you made in your previous email: ""If so, this would not mean that the series are not significantly different from each One can't dismiss the highly systematic differences at multi-centennial timescales quite so "" I'm not sure you can justify that statement based on sound statistical reasoning! I agree w/ your following statement ""Why these differences are there is the crux "" However,I hope the discussion will accurately reflect the fact that the leading hypotheses to be rejected in answering that question are 1) random uncertainty in the two series owing to differing data quality and sampling, can explain the difference and 2) systematic differences owing to differing target region and seasonality can explain any residual differences after (1). That may be a tough standard to beat, but it is the approach that Tom, Phil, Keith, and I have all been taking in addressing the issue of whether our different reconstructions are or are not inconsistent and the conclusion has in general been (see IPCC which was really a consensus of many of us, though admittedly only I was a lead author) that, despite notable differences in the low-frequency variability, the different reconstructions probably cannot be considered inconsistent given the uncertainties and differences in seasonality/spatial I have a hard time understanding why the same standard should not be applied to comparisons w/ your current reconstruction? Does your RCS reconstruction really not fall in the mix of all the other reconstructions? Is it truly an outlier w/ respect to Phil's, Tom's, MBH, and other existing hem reconstructions that are based on different seasonality and regional sampling??? We've probably had enough discussion now on this point, so I'll leave it to you to discuss the results in the way you see most fit, but I really hope you take the above points into account, in fairness to the previous I look forward to seeing the final manuscript in one form or another, in any case, cheers, mike",0

"Hi Tom, I believe NCEP has found that, generally speaking, the AMDAR/MDCRS and radiosonde temperatures are treated in a similar fashion in Like radiosonde which has varying performance from vendor to vendor, there are differences in performance between aircraft/series and temperature Brad Ballish just had a paper approved for publication (in BAMS?) that identifies the performance differences between air carriers, aircraft type, and aircraft Unfortunately, we only know how the data compare with the model guess, but not necessarily absolute ""truth"". Hopefully Brad can share his paper with this Bill Moninger and Ralph Petersen may also have published recent papers on this issue they can Ralph has published papers that compare near simultaneously launched of Vaisala RS-92 sondes with ascending/descending B-757 aircraft, showing good data One should be mindful of the potential advantages of including AMDAR data as a climate resource in addition to Data has been available in quantity since 1992 Data does not have the radiation issue as the TAT probe is shielded Data are available at all local times, nearly 24 7 365, at hundreds of major airports internationally, thereby supporting the climate diurnal temperature problem All NMCs keep databases of individual aircraft bias, based on recent performance of the each aircraft's data verses the model These information would be very useful in considering candidate aircraft for a ""climate quality"" long term database for AMDAR temperature data I suspect that the reason why AMDAR data have not been used to track atmospheric change is because no-one in the climate community has ever made an effort to use these Availability of radiosonde data in the tropics ( South America and Africa) is In response, EUCOS/E-AMDAR has been adding data collection over Africa using Air France, British Airways, and Lufthansa I have proposed expanding the data collection to include the Caribbean and South America regions from United, Delta, Continental, etc, aircraft, but have not received support for this WMO AMDAR Panel is moving to add additional regional AMDAR Programs in the developing countries, similar to the successful expansion in eastern AMDAR data are not a replacement for radiosonde, but these data certainly can add to the climate record if the data are properly processed/QC' Regards, Dave Helms",0

"Dear friends of the Imprint - SSC, After seeing the evaluation summary of our proposal, and not least the same for Millennium, it is clear to me that we have been very badly treated, first by the public advice from the Commission in Utrecht who advised the community to create a proposal which we did, but which is orthogonal to what they now have decided to negotiate, later by the random way we were reviewed and the many inconsistencies in the Compared to this the Millennium review was full of subjective phrases and a number of negative aspects were glossed The review is an insult, and it appears likely that elements in the panel bear some grudges against our In order to get the point difference between Imprint and Millennium they had to give a number of very imbalanced They also had to raise the management score of Millennium to 4 by the xtended panel despite critisisms by the reviewers that the management was not well laid I feel that the review was very biased and the result is that they will probably fund a project with only limited relevance to the call, and miss a major opportunity of integrating European paleoclimate research and climate modelling and create a new major step We have been advised to send a formal letter of complaint to the Commission, asking for a renewed evaluation, not because we think there is a good chance that it will lead to much, but we think it is important that they know that they have upset a community consisting of top level European scientists, This may help us in the longer The advice I have got is to send this to Pierre Valette, co-signed by the key partners, both their PIs and head of administration, with copies to our individual national members of the Global Change Panel of the So far there is no formal decision on which proposal to fund, this may happen in September after negotiations with the selected There is a seldom precedence in Europe that such an intervention has been successful, but very In phrasing such a letter we have to be very careful and make sure our message is clear and fair, but I think it needs to be I would therefore ask you to respond immediately to this mail as to whether you think we should go this route or We will then in a few days send out a draft for comments, if you agree that we shall send in a We have to move fast here, so I hope you will be Concerning the other proposals on what to do, there are many good ideas, and I think we should have a meeting in the autumn to discuss the strategy of securing paleo in the 7th Framwork The text is out for review now, and we all need to suggest changes through our national I will distribute a list of who this is for the various countries over the I am also working on formulating text to help launch our ideas in teh European Parliament via Attes Best wishes, Eystein",0

As Goldmacher notes: The GOP race is no longer just about amassing state It is about the arcane slog of accumulating delegates - and Trump is dominating there, His statewide wins in Pennsylvania, Maryland and Delaware netted him 47 And in Connecticut, Trump was well above 50 percent, with 13 percent of the vote counted, putting him on pace to win all 13 of its statewide He was far ahead in Rhode Island, likely to win at least 9 of its Trump was also expected to scoop up delegates at the congressional district level in the Maryland, Rhode Island and Connecticut The five states that voted Tuesday are worth a combined 118 bound The Associated Press had Trump winning 82 of them - and Read more at: Welcome to a bonus, post-primary 2016 No, this wasn't the Acela primary, but we are always coming to you from the not-so-quiet Henry Jackson (@henrycjjackson) is here to guide you through the day's campaign news, so send your tips, complaints and face-melting hot takes to user@domain WHAT MATTERS: Here are four more things we're watching today - and why they 2) PRIMARY, WHAT PRIMARY?

"Dear Tom, Thanks for your message and The problem is clearly one of the science-policy If science cannot demonstrate that it makes a difference in terms of avoided climate change and impacts if GHG concentrations are stabilised, why bother? Currently a Danish guy, Bjrn Lomborg, is making the headlines again (Guardian, New York Times, Economist), TV programmes, ) telling the public (and policymakers) not only that there aren;'t any environmental problems, but also, even if climate change may be real, it does not make any sense at all to do something about it, since efforts to control GHG emissions are expensive and the mitigation would not make any difference at all anyway in terms of avoiding negative Very popular Now clearly, scientists should clearly explain what they can say about this My expectation would indeed be that comparing climate changes resulting from reference cases and from stabilization cases would not be distinguishable until well into the 2nd half of the century (like in the GRL paper), but if this is so, so be 2050 seems a lot closer now in 2001 (2050 is THIS century and our childrens' lifetime) than it was in 1999 (when 2050 was something of the next century and some abstract next generations). It is a matter of communication skills to get the message across about the long timescales and inertia of the systems involved, and the difficulty of identifying the climate change signal in the noise of natural I would be curious what your opinion is about the UK work of Nigel Arnell, Martin Parry, John Mitchell and others, analysing the (significant) avoided impacts of 550 stabilisation from an IS98a Another strategy of concerned scientists may be not to do these analyses at all in order to avoid a possible result that the differences between reference and stabilisation can not be demonstrated in a scientifically credible and unambiguous way and hence climate policy action may be To me, this does not seem to be the honest way to I am not sure what this all implies for the planned recommended stabilization Your points about the climate sensitivity and non-CO2 gases are well I am not sure the sulfur emissions in the proposed post-SRES scenarios would make a lot of difference, since already in the SRES base cases sulfur emissions are pretty low, and these would only be slightly different (usually lower) in the stabilisation You suggest ""carefully constructed idealized scenarios"". Do you mean carefully constructed from the climate system point of view in order to get ""distinguishable results"", or carefully constructed from the socio-economic point of view so as to analyse real-world consistent and plausible futures (the latter is what Morita's exercise tried to achieve)? My answer would be: I'd like to reflect a little bit more on this and since I am a scenario expert rather than a climate expert, await reactions from people more expert in the area of climate modelling, like Sarah, Mike and Tim, and Martin himself as chair of the Thanks again, Rob Tom Wigley edu cc: user@domain, user@domain, user@domain, user@domain, Tsuneyuki MORITA , steve smith 25-08-01 , (bcc: Rob Swart/RIVM/NL) 01:47 Subject: Re: TGCIA scenario recommendations Please respond to wigley Rob and others, The key thing with doing stabilization runs with AOGCMs is (as Rob says) that the different cases ""would have to be distinguishable from one another"". This is the crux of the problem (in fact, it is a non-trivial problem even to define what is meant by ""distinguishable from one another""). A few years ago we decided to try to do some matched no-climate-policy and (550ppm) stabilization runs where the two scenarios had some semblance of (It turns out that the only similar work is that done by the Hadley Ctr, but the scenarios they used are highly ) Our runs were also idealized in that we only changed CO2 -- in the best scientific tradition of changing only one thing at a time to assess The first results of our exercise (using CSM) are in Dai et , Climate 14, 485-519, A number of things were clear from First, one cannot tell much from single realizations of the two cases -- ensemble runs are Second, as we already knew from running simple models, the no-policy and stabilization runs diverge only Even after 50 years, the two are only just distinguishable at the global-mean level; so, clearly,differences at the regional level (especially for precipitation) would not be detectible above the noise of natural So our next step was to do ensembles of 5, this time using PCM instead of CSM (this paper is in press in BAMS -- for a pdf preprint, look at ). Even then, for ensemble means, the separation between the no-policy and stabilization cases is So I devised an extended no-policy case out to 2200 (50 years beyond where the CO2 level stabilizes in the stabilization run), and we extended some of the runs out to This work is in press in GRL (and downloadable from the above site). Additional important results come from these One important result is that, even for precipitation, the patterns of change are not detectibly different between the no-policy and stabilization A second important result is that, for most of the world the intra-ensemble differences are similar to or greater than the underlying signals of Distinguishing the no-policy and stabilization runs therefore presents a much greater challenge than any of you probably There are two issues to keep in mind, The first is that PCM and CSM have quite low climate So, will things be different if one used a more sensitive model? I suspect not in any major The reason is because inter-annual variability tends to be higher in more sensitive models, so the signal-to-noise ratio may not change This also applies to the intra-ensemble noise, since the root cause of these intra-ensemble differences is the internal variability of the The second issue is that we have only changed CO2 in our We know that attempts to stabilize CO2 via emissions reductions also affect SO2 emissions -- so perhaps the no-policy and stabilization cases might be more distinguishable if one accounted for these concomitant SO2 effects? I have addressed this issue at the global-mean level in a paper on stabilization that I will attach to this (A more extensive analysis is in another paper, with Steve Smith as my co-author, that I am not ready to share with anyone just ) My judgment, as someone with quite a lot of experience in this area, is that having full spatial details will not make the problem any easier; since, as the spatial scale is reduced so the noise My recommendation from all this is that, first, you read the attached paper (and I would welcome feedback on this) and the three above-mentioned Dai et Then, you might want to re-consider what your strategy should In my view, I do not think we as a community are at the stage where we can blindly develop paired no-policy and stabilization scenarios and simply feed them into AOGCMs to see the I believe that carefully constructed idealized scenarios (perhaps based on what Morita is doing) will provide much more useful You are already probably well aware of the need to do ensemble runs, and I don't need to remind you how computationally expensive this can I hope these comments, and the papers, are I'm sorry that it is impossible for me to come to the Barbados meeting, but I am willing to help in any way that I Best wishes (and good luck), ",0

Ring-width chronologies developed from coniferous trees growing at the polar timberline in Siberia contain a very strong climatic signal, mainly summer air With these chronologies high-resolution continuous and quantitative reconstruction of summer temperatures will be As in the areas of the past and present polar and upper timberlines trees megafossils have been preserved properly in large quantities in the Holocene deposits (alluvial, lacustrine and peat), there is a good possibility to develop continuous, multi-millennial tree-ring Now the material already collected and measured (1800 subfossil wood samples from Yamal and 280 samples from Taimyr) has yielded the ring-width chronologies continuously spanning the last 3200 years (Yamal) and 950 years (Taimyr). However, there are also many more samples that have been measured and have provided data, now assembled in a number of provisionally ""floating"" chronologies covering much of the period from 7000 to 1700 (based on some 70 radiocarbon dates of samples of this wood). There is a fair chance that a 6-9000-year continuous chronologies will be constructed within the span of the proposed These chronologies and temperature reconstructions will be the first to be so long, reliable, annually-resolved and precisely-dated with known reliability across the whole of northern These reconstructions will allow to compare and contrast the details of temperature changes at the moderate-continental region of Yamal Peninsula with the continental region of Taimyr Peninsula and allow modern and predicted temperature patterns to be compared with variability patterns of pre-industrial Participants of the proposed project are the well-known institutions which are engaged in the field of dendrochronology and dendroclimatology and have collaborated with each other during the last 6 fAJL TITLE Multi-millennial-length dendroclimatic reconstructions at high-latitude regions of Siberia OBJECTIVES This research will make a major contribution to our knoweledge of high-resolution climate variability at high latitudes of Western and Middle Siberia throughout the Holocene using the unique potential of tree-ring The specific objectives of this proposal are as follows: - to develop two supra-long (each spanning 6-9000 years up to present) continuous ring-width larch chronologies at two high-latitude locations of Siberia; - using these tree-ring chronologies, tomake a multi-millennial high-resolution continuous and quantitative reconstruction of summer temperatures; - to analyse spatio-temporal patterns of temperature variability at these locations over a range of timescales (annual, decadal, multi-decadal and centennial) and their connections with various forcing factors and other annual resolution records being developed elsewhere in the Arctic and BACKGROUND Reconstruction and analysis of natural climatic changes through the whole Holocene at high latitudes are of great importance as climatic conditions, especially air temperature, are most variable and sensitive to various forcing functions (Budyko, 1980; Jones and Kelly, 1983; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 1990). However, there are a minute quantity of long, precisely-dated and high-resolution proxy climatic series for these The territory of Yamal Peninsula located on the eastern boundary of influence of the Atlantic air masses and the territory of the eastern part of Taimyr Peninsula located between the Arctic High and Siberian High are of major importance for monitoring regional and global-mean air temperatures and assessing theories and models concerned with past, current and future climate changes (Lamb, 1977; Briffa and Jones, 1993; Moses et , 1987). Tree rings as a proxy indicator of the past climatic conditions are of special interest as they allow to reconstruct climatic parameters with seasonal and annual resolution for many hundred and thousand years, to provide an exact absolute and relative dating of the tree-ring data, to establish high-frequency climate changes (from interannual to centennial timescales) with high confidence, to obtain dendroclimatic information practically for every site where trees grow at present or grew in the Intensive dendroclimatic investigations are carrying out in many countries and regions, mainly in temperate and subtropic zones (Fritts, 1976, 1991 ). At high latitudes such works began later (during the last two decades) and living trees were used primarily for developing tree-ring chronologies of 200-500 years long (Aniol and Eckstein, 1984; Shiyatov, 1984, 1986; Jacoby and D'Arrigo, 1989; Schweingruber, Briffa and Nogler, 1993; Briffa, Jones, Schweingruber, Shiyatov and Vaganov,1996; Jacoby, Wiles, D'Arrigo, 1996; Vaganov, Shiyatov and Mazepa, 1996). As in the areas of the past and present polar and upper timberlines trees megafossils have been preserved properly in large quantities on the surface and in the Holocene deposits (alluvial, lacustrine and peat), there is a possibility to develop continuous, multi-millennium and sensitive to climate tree-ring Such works began in the Polar Ural Mountains (Shiyatov, 1986; Graybill and Shiyatov, 1992; Briffa, Jones, Schweingruber, Shiyatov and Cook, 1995), in the southern part of Yamal Peninsula (Shiyatov, Surkov, 1980; Hantemirov, 1995), in Finnish Lapland and Northern Sweden (Zetterberg, Eronen and Briffa, 1995), in the eastern part of Taimyr Peninsula (Vaganov, Naurazbaev, Schweingruber and Briffa, in press) and in the Lower Indigirka River at Now the longest, continuous and absolute-dated ring-width chronologies developed for the Yamal Peninsula (spanning 3200 years) and for the Northern Scandinavia (spanning 2160 years) and the ""floating"" chronologies dated by the radiocarbon method extended back 9500 and over 7000 years Ring-width chronologies developed from coniferous trees growing at the polar timberline in moderate-continental and continental regions of Siberia contain a very strong climatic signal, mainly summer air temperatures of tree growth year (Graybill and Shiyatov, 1992; Briffa, Jones, Schweingruber, Shiyatov and Cook, 1995; Hantemirov, 1995; Vaganov, Shiyatov and Mazepa, 1996).The explained variance over the calibration and verification periods is highest reported in the literature to date (65-70%) and it allows to make a quantitative reconstructions of summer These chronologies and temperature reconstructions will be the first to be so long, reliable, annually-resolved and precisely-dated with known reliability across the whole of northern These reconstructions will allow to compare and contrast the details of temperature changes at the moderate-continental region of Yamal Peninsula with the continental region of Taimyr Peninsula and allow modern and predicted temperature patterns to be compared with variability patterns of pre-industrial Participants of the proposed project are the well-known institutions which are engaged in the field of dendrochronology and dendroclimatology and have collaborated with each other during the last 6 - The Group of Tree-Ring and Site of the Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research (Birmensdorf, Switzerland). The Group is currently engaged on a major programme of densitometric and ring-width chronology development involving many sites across the whole of the Northern Hemisphere including sites with living trees in the polar timberline area of This work is specifically designed to provide climatically-sensitive data for use in large spatial climate reconstruction , Head of the Group, is known throughout the world for his work in wood anatomy and dendrochronology and the development of tree-ring He has published extensively in different areas of wood anatomy and tree-growth research and has authored several classic - The Laboratory of Dendrochronology of the Institute of Plant and Animal Ecology of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Ekaterinburg, Russia is one of the leading laboratory in the field of dendrochronology in The Laboratory has an international reputation for its work on the developing ring-width chronologies at high latitudes and altitudes, reconstruction of climatic conditions, developing long-term chronologies, studying cycles in tree-ring series, using tree-ring data for studies of the upper and polar timberlines dynamics and forest , Head of the Laboratory, is one of the pioneers of dendrochronology in Russia and has worked for more than 30 years in the Far North and mountains of the Urals, Siberia, Far East and Middle He has published more than 130 articles and three Shiyatov was the first who began to collect subfossil wood in Russia for developing long-term - The Laboratory of Dendrochronology of the Institute of Forest of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Krasnoyarsk, Russia is another leading laboratory in the field of dendrochronology in , Director of the Institute of Forest and Head of the Laboratory of Dendrochronology, has an international reputation for his work on the cell structure of wood lyers of coniferous trees, seasonal growth variations and cambium activity, developing simulation models of seasonal tree growth, developing ring-width and cell chronologies, reconstructing climatic conditions of the past using tree-ring He has published more than 100 articles and 5 - The Climatic Research Unit of the organization of East Anglia, Norwich, Great Britain is one of the world's leading research organisation specialising in the study of climate change: climate history, current climates, projected changes and , Senior Research Associate at the Climatic Research Unit, has considerable experience in climatology and with the use of statistical methods of climate analyses and dendroclimatic reconstruction, especially with regard to large-spatial-scale reconstructions of climate patterns and published many articles on the theoretical and practical aspects of dendrochronology and dendroclimatology, and on use of paleoclimate data for understanding current and possible future SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION RESEARCH ACTIVITIES Tree-ring data will be obtained from living trees and subfossil wood of Siberian larch (Larix sibirica ) in western Siberia and Gmelini larch (Larix Gmelini Pilger) in central The first location is situated in the southern part of Yamal Peninsula (67-688N, 69-718E), the second location in the eastern part of Taimyr Peninsula (71-738N, 98-1058E). There is a great many properly preserved subfossil wood in the Holocene deposits at both locations, mainly in the alluvial and peat The main variable measured will be ring This variable reflects properly climate influences on tree growth at the polar timberline areas of Siberia having a continental Ring-width chronologies for the last 400-500 years will be developed from the oldest living Extensions to these chronologies back further in time will be made by using subfossil material, joined with the living material by standard crossdating High-precision radiocarbon dates will be used for rough dating of ""floating"" tree-ring The sampling subfossil wood and development of the Yamal's supra-long chronology began since 1982 by the workers of the Laboratory of Dendrochronology (Ekaterinburg). Most intensively this work was carried out during the last five Now the material already collected and measured (1800 subfossil wood cuts) has yielded the ring-width chronology continuously spanning the last 3200 However, there are also many more samples that have been measured and have provided data, now assembled in a number of provisionally ""floating"" chronologies covering much of the period from 7000 to 1700 (based on some 45 radiocarbon dates of samples of this wood). These chronologies separated by 50 to 500 year length There is a fair chance that a 9000-year continuous chronology will be constructed for this location within the span of the proposed Similarly, work with a shorter history than the Yamal's research has clearly established potential to build a chronology at least as long in the Taimyr Peninsula where the modern polar timberline extends to about 72830'N, most northern over the This work is not so advanced as in Yamal, but the work to date suggests that very rapid progress is Samples from living and dead trees have already been assembled at the Laboratory of Dendrochronology (Krasnoyarsk) into the 950-year continuous The collections from this location are not so extensive as those made to date at Yamal (280 subfossil wood samples), but there is an abundant supply of subfossil trees, many with over 300 annual 25 radiocarbon dates of samples of this material suggest major phases of tree growth around 8500 and 5000 The general distribution of the radiocarbon dates suggests that, eventually, sufficient trees can probably be located to span the whole of the last 10000 It is not expected that a continuous 10000-year ring-width chronology will be produced within timeframe of this However, there are good prospects of producing a 5-6000- year chronology to the RESEARCH RESULTS During three years we expect to develop the continuous and good-replicated tree-ring 9000-year larch chronology for the Yamal Peninsula and the 5-6000-year larch chronology for the Taimyr Using these chronologies we intend to reconstruct and analyse a summer temperature variation at several time scales (annual, decadal, multi-decadal and centennial) and compare the data obtained with other high-resolution Holocene-length proxy data (ice cores, laminated sediments, historical documents). The results of this project will be published primarily in the scientific literature in Russian and English and presented at different national and international Because of the fundamental interdisciplinarity and collaborative interaction within the subgroups, a number of multi-authored papers will be The individual and mean ring-width chronologies and the reconstructions produced will be distributed to the international scientific community through submission to the International Tree-Ring Data Bank (Boulder, Colorado, USA) and to other national and international institutions and data MANAGEMENT INFORMATION TASK DIVISION Dr (Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research) will be the project co-ordinator on the proposed project from the INTAS Dr (Institute of Plant and Animal Ecology) will be the responsible scientist on the proposed project and he will take part in collecting, dating, developing and analysing the multi-millennial ring-width chronology at the area of Yamal The next young scientists of the Institute will be involved in the project: Rashit Hantemirov, Candidate of Biological Sciences, 34 years He will take part in collecting, cross-dating and analysing the Alexander Surkov, technician, 30 years He will take part in collecting, preparing and measuring the subfossil wood Dr (Institute of Forest) will be the responsible scientist on the proposed project and he will take part in collecting, dating, developing and analysing the multi-millennial ring-width chronology at the area of Taimyr The next young scientists will be involved in the project: Mukhtar Naurazbaev, junior research fellow,35 years He will take part in collecting, preparing, measuring, cross- dating and analysing the Alexander , post-graduate, 25 years He will take part in data processing, density measurements, chronology Dmitry , post-graduate, 26 years He will take part in cross-dating, data processing, chronology Dr (Climatic Research Unit) will be the responsible scientist on the proposed project and he will take part in analysing growth-climate relationships, developing statistical models of tree growth, extracting climatic signal, reconstructing and analysing climatic conditions of the remote PLANNING To carry-out the objectives of this proposal the workers of the Russian laboratories will carry out an intensive collecting subfossil wood during summers of 1997-1998 at two high-latitude locations (Yamal and Taimyr peninsulas) using helicopters, boats and To finish the development of the Yamal chronology it is necessary to collect additionally no less than 300-400 cuts of subfossil Much more intensive collecting (600-800 cuts for two field seasons) is needed to develop the Taimyr All samples collected during these two years and earlier will be measured and cross-dated at Ekaterinburg and Krasnoyarsk laboratories until the middle of The Russian laboratories together with the Climatic Research Unit of the organization of East Anglia during 1997-1999 will be analysing the material obtained (standardization of individual series, development of mean chronologies, studying growth-climate relationships, developing statistical models of tree growth, extracting climatic signal, reconstructing and analysing climatic conditions of the remote past).

I do wish Mike had not rushed around sending out preliminary and incorrect early responses - the waters are really muddied He would have done better to have taken things slowly and worked out a final response before publicising this Excel files, other files being created early or now deleted is really confusing things!

"Dear Keith, After our long silence we would like inform you about our sucesses, problems and The main success to our mind is the We have filled up the gap (1350-1250 BC) between the absolutely dated 3250-year Yamal chronology and the nearest floating It was happened few weeks ago using samples collected in Now there are no obstacles to develop in the nearest future the 7000-7500-year length continuous Now we are working with ancient samples: searching the places of missing and false rings, making more precise datings of individual chronologies and so During this time interval we have some For example, no more samples were found up to now to confirm the absence of false ring near 360 This summer we intend to hold an expedition from the end of June to the middle of August in the southern part of Yamal peninsula to collect more samples of subfossil wood which have a great many of rings, are sensitive and cover the intervals represented by insufficient quantity of samples at We think that during this field season we must collect a necessary quantity of samples to develop a well represented 7000-7500 years Next year we intend to collect subfossil samples of wood from the middle part of Yamal peninsula to reconstruct the dynamics of polar timberline during the Holocene in detail using a large number of tree remnants absolutely dated by dendrochronological This year we have a small grant the from the Russsian Science Foundation for developing the Yamal supra-long chronology (approximately 4000 USD). But we are not sure that all this sum we will For example, last year we have received 37% from the promised sum of As cost of helicopter's rent is increased again this year (about $ for one hour), we have the problem how to reach our research area in the Yamal Vaganov have the same problem with organisation of field works over the territory of Taimyr That is why we and ask you to transfer each of us USD until the end of June from the ADVANCE project, if it is Last summer, when I was in England, you promised to help us with money to organise field works this I am finishing a measurements of rings of subfossil wood samples collected last year on the surface and in one lake and some bogs in the Polar Ural I found a little more ancient wood (not all samples are dated until now) and can prolong this chronology at least up to one hundred This summer I will be in the mountains and try to collect wood from other I want to develop the Polar Urals chronology for the last Now we are preparing the paper concerning Yamal project in Russian and we need to cite the paper prepared for Dendrochronologia in Could you send to us the last version of this articles by e-mail or by post?

"Tim, As promised some comments on the General: It is very good, just what is needed and puts the last 4 years of debate into the right General: why consistently 'climate changes' rather than the more usual 'climate change'? Abstract, line 10: why only quote as high as and not the lowest correlation (which actually is more to the point - it is still very good after the 2020s, even for precip). Abstract, lines 12-13: as worded this does not quite follow, although I see from later that the ellipses used are at 95% Just because they fall outside natural variability does not in itself prove they are , lines 17-19 (and also several places on ): impacts are mentioned, but nothing said about It is really adaptation actions/decisions that are crucial, impacts are only one way to get Alter the , line -10: add 'necessarily' between 'not' and 'be'. AOGCMs may actually do not so bad a job on occasions about climate change (relative changes for example), so don't completely dismiss this , section 2: general point: there is no list or table or statement about exactly what these 17 experiments The models are listed, but not the which SRES scenarios did which modelling group and how many ensembles? For the lay person this is not , top line: you should perhaps make the point that simple bias indices such as these may partly be explained by elevation offsets (model height real height). It is to my mind a mitigating factor than can work in a model's favour (not always). It should be mentioned, because the biases may not be due to just dumb models, but due to simple resolution issues that can be adjusted A similar point perhaps applies in the next about ocean/land OK, you could say this just shows how bad models are, but it perhaps gives people a poorer view of the model physics and credibility than is truly Another point to mention in this para about is the obvious point about decadal natural It's a tall order to expect the models to get the 1961-90 monthly mean exactly right, owing to internal Indeed, give such variability can be plus/minus 10-20% or more it would be astonishing if they Be generous to models I , middle - interesting point about ECHAM4 and NCAR masks!! , para 2: didn't you have A1FI available from Hadley? Surely it could have been used to test this? Last sentence in this para: why 'evidently conform'? , last line: interesting point here: if you claim the pattern-scaling didn't work for the 2020s because of nat var (S/N ratios) then why actually should we go with the raw model results anyway - certainly if it is the signal we are interested in (and not the noise), it suggests the raw 2020s models results are misleading us! This is a rather circular argument I realise but the bottom line point again comes back to S/N ratios and the role of nat decadal variabiliy, for Are we going to recommend adaptations to noise or to signals - and why? , middle para: what about mentioning climate sensitivity here? I know its out of vogue now, but PCM and NIES differences are explained by overall model sensitivity aren't , para 4: this point about where agreement occurs between models is Some people - I heard Wigley do it recently - write models off at regional scales precip changes because they all They do for some regions, but not all and where we think we have physical grounds to accept agreement as ( UK; UKCIP02 scenario metholody) then we should be confident to say , line -7: why use 'forecasting' here? Could confuse some The old argument about terms I And again top line on is dangerous - we can ""predict"" variability in a stochastic sense using Change the , line 9: not only are they difficult to forsee, they are simply unforseeable to a significant extent because it is we who determine them; I prefer to make the distinction between different types of prediction problem more , lines 19-20: I don't like the use of 'truth' and 'precise' It implies a strong natural science view prediction and the competence of science (modellers!) which I think should be , para 4: the inter-model differences bit being as large as the inter-scenario Again at least mention the role of nat var here - some of these inter-model differences must be due to nat var, not simply models not able to agree with each , para 1: I think the stabilisation case should be mentioned What about pattern-scaling stab scenarios? As I hear it from DEFRA and Hadley here in UK this was a big issue at the TGCIA Make a comment at least; I think in principle p-scaling is probably OK (within some limits) even I think you should make reference to some of Tim Mitchell's work here (and/or elsewhere) since he has looked at some of these things His thesis or his CC paper And finally, w/o sounding as self-serving as Tom Wigley, it would be nice if you could reference (perhaps in section ) the Hulme/Brown (1998) paper in CR which was the first time I published scatter plots in this form for GCMs results - and possible the first time this form of presentation had been used anywhere (but I stand corrected of course; maybe I simply picked it up from someone else). So there it is: a great piece of work and a good write I don't know Kimmo but pass on my congratulations to I'll look out for it on the web Best wishes, Mike",0
"Mike, Here are my thoughts on the text you Keith will be sending some as well hopefully later One important aspect Keith will address is whether you're using the latest Briffa et al We know you're not but the one with the greater low frequency and therefore much better chance of looking much better with the other two series, isn't yet We know it looks better in plots we have Specifics : p1 line 10 - say mid-19th century rather than the 20th century lines 18-20 - seems a bit too much here with three refs on laminated line 46 Add Briffa et al (1998b) to Cook(1995). p2 line 59 - I would suggest changing 'a particularly' to 'the most' . line 64 - I would add a reference here to the paper by Crowley and Kim (1999) in GRL (July) where this aspect is also p3 line 101 - I would add Argentina as well as Chile adding a ref to Villalba (1990 ) in line 108 change 'key' to 'vital' line 119 'have providing' to 'provide' . There are several instances where the text doesn't read that I suspect as there are several iterations to go it is not that important yet ! The coral section is just about the right size now and is justly devoid of references ! p4 line 151 I would add a reference here to Morgan and van Ommen (1997) 'Seasonality in late-Holocene climate from ice core records', The Holocene 7, This is the Law Dome core which is the best available with regards to dating in either It should be As with the coral section the ice core section expresses some cautionary notes with regard to dating etc which I think are I suspect teh contrast with the tree-ring section will draw some Just a warning ! As none of the multiproxy reconstuctions use any sediment information this section seems overlarge and could be p189 century-scale add in the 'y' p5 The borehole section is also a bit I don't know whether the map really adds Not that vehement on With respect to comapring high and low frequency aspects the diagram comparing CET with the UK boreholes is now I've sent a copy to It is in : Jones PD, 1999 : Classics in physical geography revisited - Manley's CET Progress in Physical Geography 23, line 245 the 'is' is not p6 I still think that a reference to Raper et al (1996) would be good This models a glacier in northern Sweden using the northern Fennoscandian temperature reconstructions since AD Again it shows how a low frequency estimate (the glacial snout position) can be compared with a high-frquency temperature reconstruction from Raper, SCB, Briffa KR and Wigley TML, 1996: Glacial change in northern Sweden from AD 500: a simple geometric model of Journal of Glaciology 42, line 268 IPCC(1996) earlier - is it 95 or 96 p 7 line 295 I would like to add my paper in Reviews of Geophysics in 1999 as that also says that 1998 was likely to be the warmest year of the line 334 I would like to see Bradley (1999). I must get a copy from Ray in p7-9 All need a careful read through for English and the At the bottom of p8 I think you make too much of the differences in the ranking of the The boreholes would agree with my series with the 17th being colder than the 19th, although they may not be able to resolve the timescales Is the Crowley and Lowery (1999) the paper Tom's submitted to Ambio ? I've not commented much on this final section as again I suspect there are many things you will have to justify in the next two sets of On the whole I think most is OK and I support the final I don't believe the astronomical argument as an explaination over the last 1000 years but we can differ on I know I would have written this final section somehat differently with different emphases and slants but the basic final conclusion would have been the Cheers Phil Phil Jones Climatic Research Unit Telephone +44 (0) 1603 592090 School of Environmental Sciences Fax +44 (0) 1603 507784 organization of East Anglia Norwich Email user@domain NR4 7TJ UK",0
"Mike your words are a real boost to me at the I found myself questioning the whole process and being often frustrated at the formulaic way things had to be done - often wasting time and going down dead I really thank you for taking the time to say these kind words . I tried hard to balance the needs of the science and the IPCC , which were not always the I worried that you might think I gave the impression of not supporting you well enough while trying to report on the issues and uncertainties . Much had to be removed and I was particularly unhappy that I could not get the statement into the SPM regarding the AR4 reinforcement of the results and conclusions of the I tried my best but we were basically railroaded by I am happy to pass the mantle on to someone else next I feel I have basically produced nothing original or substantive of my own since this whole process I am at this moment , having to work on the ENV submission to the forthcoming UK Research Assessment exercise , again instead of actually doing some useful research !

If you look at the few remaining contests on the Democratic primary calendar, the major news outlets - barring something devastating happening to the Clinton campaign in the next few weeks - are likely to declare Clinton the nominee on June More specifically, New Jersey will likely push Clinton across the finish line, and she may clinch the nomination even before the polls close in If major news outlets declare Clinton the nominee on June 7, they will be counting superdelegates, as they did in 2008 when they declared Barack Obama the presumptive Democratic nominee on June Now, you might ask ""why include superdelegates?"" It's a fair question; superdelegates can change their minds, after For that reason, we haven't included them in our delegate tracker - there was a chance that superdelegates backing Clinton might switch sides, particularly if Sanders was able to win a majority of elected Does Clinton need superdelegates in 2016 more than Obama did in 2008? Hillary Clinton will almost certainly clinch the Democratic nomination with the aid of superdelegates -- and it is not uncommon for a Democratic candidate to do so in a competitive late season Barack Obama also needed a boost from superdelegates in 2008, though Clinton is relying slightly more on superdelegates than Obama Who are the superdelegates? Since 1984, the Democratic Party has set aside seats at its convention for party leaders including Democratic members of Congress, governors, past presidents and members of the Democratic National Committee, giving these leaders a role in choosing the These delegates are commonly referred to as Superdelegates, or unpledged delegates, serve by virtue of their party position or elected They are not bound by state primaries and caucuses and can back any candidate they prefer at the They can also change their minds at any Superdelegates make up about 15 percent of the total number of Democratic delegates and 30 percent of the number needed to With email probe nearing end, FBI may question Hillary Clinton I agents probing whether Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server imperiled government secrets appear close to completing their work, a process experts say will probably culminate in a sit-down with the former secretary of The FBI has already spoken with Huma Abedin, a Clinton confidant who was among the Democratic presidential front-runner's closest aides at the State Former chief of staff Cheryl Mills is also cooperating with the investigation, according to her Bernie Sanders Will Bernie Sanders Hurt His Own Cause? Bernie Sanders's beliefs have been obvious from the He thinks wealthy elites exert too much influence over American He wants the government to lessen income He believes climate change is a pressing threat to the The clarity and overarching ambition of his agenda has been central to his appeal and expectations-defying political success so If Sanders wants his political revolution to last, he will need to win widespread support for his ideas well into the Yet as the primary election draws to a close, the campaign has increasingly made arguments that may undercut the long-term viability of the movement that has coalesced around the Vermont Democratic Party Gives Bernie Sanders Bigger Role In Shaping Its Platform In a move meant to cool down tensions between his campaign and the Democratic establishment, the Democratic Party will give Bernie Sanders ( ) a greater role to play in establishing its platform at this summer's Democratic National Under an agreement the party reached with Sanders and opponent Hillary Clinton, Sanders can select five people to serve on the party's platform committee, a third of the committee's Clinton will name six members, and Debbie Wasserman Schultz ( ), the party chair, will name four, according to the Washington Unity Won't Come Easily for Democrats It looks like Bernie Sanders's political agitation is paying The Democratic National Convention Committee announced the 15 members of its platform drafting committee on Monday, a selection designed to give the Vermont senator an unusual amount of influence on the As The Washington Post reported, ""party leaders hope [the move] will soothe a bitter split with backers of the long-shot challenger to Hillary "" Sanders has been allowed to name five members to the committee charged with writing the party platform, while Clinton named The tally reflects the fact that Clinton leads Sanders in the popular vote for the presidential primary election, but nevertheless grants Sanders allies a significant amount of Bernie Sanders' Campaign Drops Tommy Chong as Intro Speaker Hours Before Rally Tommy Chong is in disbelief after he was disinvited by the Bernie Sanders campaign from introducing the presidential hopeful hours before a rally in East Los The iconic comic actor and outspoken marijuana advocate tells The Hollywood Reporter that the Sanders campaign was happy to have his endorsement months back, but when it came time for the two men to appear in public together, someone got ""cold feet,"" he ""It's lip service to get the votes, but they don't want to endorse what I stand for and what I've stood for all my professional career,"" Chong said right after he was uninvited to the ""It was an "" In an email to THR, a Sanders spokesman said, ""We appreciate his support but a scheduling issue came "" Chong, who was invited on Sunday to Sanders' noon rally in Lincoln Park, says he is sure the campaign put distance between himself and Sanders over the marijuana issue, calling the move a ""weakness"" by the Sanders' He joked that his hair and makeup were done for Republican Party Candidates Donald Trump How Much Can Donald Trump Raise? Donald Trump is holding his first campaign fundraiser Tuesday in the very-difficult-to-spell Albuquerque, as he sets about trying to meet his self-proclaimed goal of raising $1 billion for his presidential election-a long way from his days proclaiming to self-fund his To date, Trump has spent more than $40 million of his own cash on his campaign in the form of loans, but has assured donors he won't use their cash to repay But while Trump is throwing around the huge number, senior aides are cautioning his that it's an unrealistic total, requiring the candidate to raise an average of roughly $6 million every day through November A more reasonable goal, they say, is between $400m-$ While some donors are still firmly in the #NeverTrump camp, Trump's challenge won't be from opponents, but from the absence of an organized financial Donald Trump's Steadfast Commitment to Climate-Change Denial Just Got a Bit More Baffling Noam Chomsky, the celebrated linguist and left-wing political theorist, was recently asked to contemplate the consequences of a Trump ""Well, first we have to ask if he means what he's saying,"" the elderly intellectual ""If he does the human species is in very deep "" Chomsky paused, and his audience had a moment to wonder which Trump gaffe had so galled the patron saint of the American left: Was it his plan to ""take out"" terrorists' families? Or the full-throated defense of military torture? The Donald's praise for punching protesters? Or that loose talk about using nukes?

"Dear colleagues, you may already know it: the EU FP5 second call for proposals is out since today ( ), as expected, and the deadline for submission is Feb The new call does indeed answer a question I have been wondering about when I heard from many first-call projects that they were asked to The present call is only for the slots that were, last year, declared to be opened at this stage (not for the previous slots). Probably the re-invited proposals then still bid for the old money (or at least, I hope so). There is however one important exception: "" Mitigation and adaptation to global change"". About this, the official document says ""re-open because of the quality of proposal received in reply to the call of 20 March 1999"". Further down, they point out that Kyoto really is tremendously important for the commission (""primary objective""), and then comes the following far-reaching sentence: ""If one takes into account the time lag between the research results, the political decisions and the actual emission reduction it is evident that the year 2000 is the last opportunity for research to cover the remaining analytical gaps of "" ( , page 6).

"Hi Caspar, Thanks for the Frankly, Von storch is being duplicitous He may tell certain audiences (like the NCAR group last month) that he is not suggesting that the GKSS simulation is reealistic, because he knows he'll get skewered if he claims But then he turns around to the press, and talks about how the Moberg et al reconstruction matches their model, I frankly consider this dishonest, at best! If what Stefan says is true (that the entire long-term trend, including the cold LIA in the model, is all due to the spinup problem), then it completely invalidates the use of that model for testing statistical reconstruction methodologies which require physically-consistent patterns of variance in the calibration period to reconstruct the But that's a separate As we now know, the far more damning fact is that Von Storch et al knowingly applied a procedure which is not the MBH98 procedure, and they think they can get away w/ admitting this now in some obscure Italian journal which isn't even in the ISI Tim/Phil/Keith: you may not know about the latter, but Caspar should be able to fill you in on this Meanwhile, lets enjoy the media fiesta on Mike",0

My sense (being relatively new to this field compared to everyone else) is that within the neo- and mesoclimate research community there is a (relatively small?) group of people who don't or won't ""get it"" and there is nothing we can do about them aside from continuing to publish quality work in quality journals (or calling in a Mafia hit).

"Peck and Eystein we are having trouble to express the real message of the reconstructions - being scientifically sound in representing uncertainty , while still getting the crux of the information across It is not right to ignore uncertainty, but expressing this merely in an arbitrary way (and as a total range as before) allows the uncertainty to swamp the magnitude of the changes through time . We have settled on this version (attached) of the Figure which we hoe you will agree gets the message over but with the rigor required for such an important We have added a box to show the ""probability surface"" for the most likely estimate of past temperatures based on all published By overlapping all reconstructions and giving a score of 2 to all areas within the 1 standard error range of the estimates for each reconstruction , and a score of 1 for the area between 1 and 2 standard errors, you build up a composite picture of the most likely or ""concensus"" path that temperatures took over the last 1200 years (note - now with a linear time axis). This still shows the outlier ranges , preserving all the information, but you see the central most likely area well , and the comparison of past and recent temperature levels is not as influenced by the outlier What do you think? We have experimented with different versions of the shading and this one shows up quite well - but we may have to use some all grey version as the background to the overlay of the model We have also experimented with changing the normalisation base for the model/reconstruction Figure , but using the same short modern period as for the first Figure is not satisfactory - more on this We have added in Oerlemans curve as many insisted - but we only have the GLOBAL curve - can you get the separate North and Southern Hemisphere curves (with uncertainty) . I do not see that the new model runs from Germany/Switzerland will fit easily in the existing Figure and need to be separate! I am really struggling with the text also - really need more time!!!!

"Dear All, I just wanted to keep you informed about the status of our draft JGR First, thanks to all of you for your comments - they were very I am now in the process of revising the paper, and hope to have a new draft ready by After several discussions with Tom, I have decided to repeat the volcano/ENSO signal separation for the observed data and for the GSOP The reason for this is that there was a conceptual flaw in what I had done The flaw related to the determination of the ""pre-eruption"" reference temperature, used as a baseline for estimating the maximum volcanically-induced Let's call this baseline temperature ""TBASE"". Previously, I was estimating TBASE for Pinatubo and El Chichon from either the raw or Gauss-filtered temperature data at time t (the eruption month). If I was calculating TBASE from the filtered data, the estimate of TBASE was biased by ""contamination"" from post-eruption In other words, since I was using a 13-term Gaussian filter, temperature values from t + 6 months were influencing TBASE, likely leading to an underestimate of the true TBASE I've now modified the program so that TBASE is not computed from the filtered data; instead, it is an average of the temperature anomalies in the MREF months prior to the There is some sensitivity to the choice of MREF (I've been experiment with values ranging from 6-18 months), which again underscores the uncertainties inherent in separating ENSO and volcanic The maximum volcanically-induced cooling is still estimated using filtered data, but now I'm using a 5-term binomial filter rather than the 13-term These changes require repeating most of the analyses in the Preliminary results indicate that the revised estimation of TBASE increases the ratio of the Chichon/Pinatubo maximum coolings, and brings this closer to the ratio of the Chichon/Pinatubo radiative Tom has also made a number of useful suggestions regarding reorganization and shortening of various sections of the Hopefully the next iteration will be a little shorter than the current version of the paper! I will be out of my office next week, but should be back by October With best regards, and thanks again for all your help, Ben",0

"Malcolm seems to have done a good job sorting out these constituent sets , and I don't have anything to add other than agreeing that as a general principal , where possible, original chronologies should be used in preference to reconstructed temperature series ( the latter having been already optimized using simple or multiple regression to fit the target temperature series ). This applies not only to our western US reconstructions (which it should be stressed are based on very flexible curve fitting in the standardisation - and inevitably can show little variance on time scales longer than a decade or so) but also to the Tornetrask and Polar Urals reconstructions (each of which was based on ring width and density data , but standardised to try to preserve centennial variability - though the density series had by far the largest regression coefficients). There is though a question regarding the PCs of the Siberian network (presumably provided by Eugene?) . The correlation between density and ring width can get high in central and eastern parts of the network , so even though these are different variables , it might not be strictly true to think of them as truly independent (statistically) of the density chronologies we use from the Schweingruber network ( there may also be a standardisation issue here , as the density chronologies were standardised with Hugershoff functions for our initial network work (as reported in the Holocene Special Issue) whereas your PC amplitudes may be based on ""Corridor Standardisation"" - which likely preserves less low frequency? ) . These remarks are simply for clarification and discussion , and I too will wait on your response draft , though I would throw in the pot the fact that omitting the time dependent stuff would simplify the message at his cheers Keith",0

"Hi Tim, Thanks for the We can certainly spend some time talking through some of the points I guess I am still finding it difficult to believe that an rbar of has any operational significance in estimating It is kind of like doing correlations between tree rings and climate: a correlation of may be statistically significant, but have no practical value at all for The same goes for an rbar of in my I agree that what I suggested ( testing the individual correlations for significance and only using those above the some significance level for estimating rbar) is somewhat ad hoc and not theoretically However, it is also true that correlations below the chosen significance threshold are ""not significantly different from zero"" and could be ignored in principle, just as we would do in testing variables for entry into a regression This would clearly muddy (a nice choice of words!) the rbar waters, I In terms of the problem I am working on (computing bootstrap confidence limits on annual values of 1205 RCS-detrended tree-ring series from 14 sites), it is hard to know what to Certainly, using Neff will result in almost none of the annual means being statistically significant over the past 1200 I don't believe that this is ""true"". Other highly conservative methods of testing significance result in a very high frequency of similarly negative results, the test of significance in spectral analysis that takes into account the multiplicity effect of testing all frequencies in an a posteriori way (see Mitchell et 1966, Climatic Change, 41). If you use this correction, virtually no ""significant"" band-limited signals will ever be identified in paleoclimatological So, this test has very low statistical I think that this is the crux issue: Type-1 Type-2 error in statistical hypothesis The Neff correction greatly increases the probability of Type-2 error, while virtually eliminating Type-1 So, truth or Consider one last ""thought experiment"". Suppose you came to Earth from another planet to study its You put out 1,000 randomly distributed recording thermometers and measure daily temperatures for 1 Earth You then pick up the thermometers and return to your planet where you estimate the mean annual temperature of the Earth for that one How many degrees of freedom do you have? Presumably, Now, suppose that you leave those same recording thermometers in place for 20 years and calculate 20 annual From these 20-year records, you also calculate an rbar of How many degrees of freedom per year do you have now? 999 or What has changed? Certainly not the observation Does this mean that we can just as accurately measure the Earth's mean annual temperature with only 10 randomly placed thermometers if they provide temperature records with an rbar of over a 20 year period? I wouldn't bet on it, but your theory implies it to be Surely, one would have more confidence ( smaller confidence intervals) in mean annual tempertures estimated from a 1000-station Cheers, Ed",0

Is his issue that he wants a grandson who is a monster or that he's afraid of the consequences to his family if he isn't? Why is it good for Johnny to be in on Drac's plan to take Dennis away?

This is The version containing the warnings was the last for which scientists alone were After that it went out to review by The IPCC is a governmental body as well as a scientific Both sides have to sign off on the The scientists involved adamantly deny that there was undue pressure, or that the scientific integrity of their report was We do know there were political agendas, and that the scientists had to fight As one of the report's 33 authors put it: ""A lot of us devoted a lot of time to ensuring that the changes requested by national delegates did not affect the scientific "" Yet small changes in language which individually may not amount to much can, cumulatively, change the tone and message of a Deliberately or not, this is what seems to have Senior IPCC scientists are not willing to discuss the changes, beyond denying that there was political They regard the drafting process as This is an understandable reservation, but the case raises serious doubts about the IPCC A little more transparency would go a long way to removing those -- Here's the Pearce column: Climate report 'was watered down' 10 March 2007 From New Scientist Print [2]Subscribe and get 4 free Fred Pearce BRITISH researchers who have seen drafts of last month's report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change claim it was significantly watered down when governments became involved in writing David Wasdell, an independent analyst of climate change who acted as an accredited reviewer of the report, says the preliminary version produced by scientists in April 2006 contained many references to the potential for climate to change faster than expected because of ""positive feedbacks"" in the climate Most of these references were absent from the final His assertion is based on a line-by-line analysis of the scientists' report and the final version, which was agreed last month at a week-long meeting of representatives of more than 100 Wasdell told New Scientist: ""I was astounded at the alterations that were imposed by government agents during the final stage of The evidence of collusional suppression of well-established and world-leading scientific material is "" He has prepared a critique, ""Political Corruption of the IPCC Report?"", which claims: ""Political and economic interests have influenced the presented scientific "" He plans to publish the document online this week at [3] Wasdell is not a climatologist, but his analysis was supported this week by two leading UK climate scientists and policy Ocean physicist Peter Wadhams of the organization of Cambridge, who made the discovery that Arctic ice has thinned by 40 per cent over the past 25 years and also acted as a referee on the IPCC report, told New Scientist: ""The public needs to know that the policy-makers' summary, presented as the united words of the IPCC, has actually been watered down in subtle but vital ways by governmental agents before the public was allowed to see "" ""The public needs to know that the summary has been watered down in subtle but vital ways by governmental agents"" Crispin Tickell, a long-standing UK government adviser on climate and a former ambassador to the UN, says: ""I think David Wasdell's analysis is very useful, and unique of its Others have made comparable points but not in such analytic "" Wasdell's central charge is that ""reference to possible acceleration of climate change [was] consistently removed"" from the final This happened both in its treatment of potential positive feedbacks from global warming in the future and in its discussion of recent observations of collapsing ice sheets and an accelerating rise in sea For instance, the scientists' draft report warned that natural systems such as rainforests, soils and the oceans would in future be less able to absorb greenhouse gas It said: ""This positive feedback could lead to as much as C of added warming by "" The final version does not include this It acknowledges that the feedback could exist but says: ""The magnitude of this feedback is "" Similarly, the draft warned that warming will increase atmospheric levels of water vapour, which acts as a greenhouse ""Water vapour increases lead to a strong positive feedback,"" it ""New evidence estimates a 40 to 50 per cent amplification of global mean "" This was absent from the published version, replaced elsewhere with the much milder observation ""Water vapour changes represent the largest "" The final edit also removed references to growing fears that global warming is accelerating the discharge of ice from major ice sheets such as the Greenland This would dramatically speed up rises in sea levels and may already be doing The 2006 draft said: ""Recent observations show rapid changes in ice sheet flows,"" and referred to an ""accelerating trend"" in sea-level Neither detail made the final version, which observed that ""ice flow from Greenland and could increase or decrease in future"". Wasdell points out recent findings which show that the rate of loss from ice sheets is doubling every six years, making the suggestion of a future decrease ""highly unlikely"". Some of the changes were made at the meeting of government invigilators that finalised the report last month in But others were made earlier, after the draft report was first distributed to governments in Senior IPCC scientists contacted by New Scientist have not been willing to discuss how any changes took place but they deny any political However, ""if it is true, it's disappointing"", says Mike Mann, director of the Earth System Science Center at Pennsylvania State organization in organization Park and a past lead author for the ""Allowing governmental delegations to ride into town at the last minute and water down conclusions after they were painstakingly arrived at in an objective scientific assessment does not serve society "" From issue 2594 of New Scientist magazine, 10 March 2007, page 10 --",0

I have the pdf of the 1986 paper and 38 rejected for urban warming trends (31 in America and 7 in Europe - none elsewhere) out of 239 were rejected for other Brohan et al is the best We included urbanization as one of the biases (one sided as urban should lead to warming, so if you look very, very closely at the error range in the paper you'll see it is slightly I've been giving some talks here and have more At CMA I've found they have a homogenized dataset of 745 stations for the country which they are preapred to give me at some point for They have adjusted for all site moves but not for It seems that it is almost impossible for sites here to be rural (maybe only 1% of the total).

"Dear CLAs/LAs As you all know, in my Victoria follow-up e-mail of 2 August I presented a summary of the agreement we reached in Victoria on a common use of terminology to express degree of likelihood in the At that time the word or term to be used for the central box of 33 to 66% had not been agreed and the word ""inconclusive"" was proposed for that Since that time there has been a lengthy discussion, including Working Groups II and III, regarding the best word to be used in this To cut a long story short the term we would now like you to use for this middle category is ""medium likelihood"". I am sorry I have not been able to canvas this around all of you but from the discussions this term was agreed by all to be the best In particular, it clearly maintains the scale as one of degrees of likelihood, whereas inconclusive could be confused as to whether a degree of likelihood was being expressed or whether there was insufficient information to conclude a I attach a table showing what should now be the final During the discussions it became clear that in addition to making likelihood statements it is sometimes more appropriate to express statements in terms of a degree of confidence, and indeed several chapters use this As you know the Uncertainties Guidance paper by Richard Moss and Steve Schneider recommends a scale of confidence from Very Low to Very High WGII in particular are using this scale and so I would ask that, if you choose to express things in terms of a level of confidence, that you use the terms as they are laid down in the guidance This in no way affects the use of the likelihood scale where this is more For example, if we are highly uncertain how well a model handles a particular process, we may have ""very low confidence"" in a model result which is highly dependent on this If we have no other corroborating evidence we may therefore conclude that there is insufficient information to assign a likelihood in this By following the guidance paper when expressing a level of confidence we will hopefully improve the consistency between the two Incidentally, if there are instances in the WGII report where they are able express degrees of likelihood they are going to try and use our Thirdly, there has been a lot of discussion about the impression which the likelihood scale, if taken out of context, could give for low likelihood, high consequence events, such as a disintegration of the WAIS or a shutdown of the THC in the next Please bear in mind that policymakers must balance likelihood and consequence in deciding whether or not to take Therefore please take extra care when considering text for these types of issues as simply expressing them as ""extremely unlikely"" does not give the full For example, you could say an aircraft was ""extremely unlikely"" to crash on its next flight but if there was a 1% chance I would not fly on While it is a true statement the right balance is only achieved when the consequence is also brought in to put the risk in I apologise for this late change to our scale but I hope you all agree that it is an If anything is not clear about any of the above please do not hesitate to contact Best regards Dave ",0

including that of the former Florida governor, whose passivity in the face of Trump's taunts and insults doomed his once-inevitable seeming They also took notes as Marco Rubio tried and failed to match Trump in an unflattering game of personal Hillary Clinton's new ads use Republican leaders-and Donald Trump himself-to bash Trump After Donald Trump's convincing win in the Republican party's Indiana state primary this week-and the departure of his main rival Ted Cruz from the race-it appears he really will be Hillary Clinton's rival for the US presidency, however surreal it might still be to (His victory has many Republicans leaving the party, and even burning their voter registration ) For Clinton, the question now becomes how to best attack Luckily for her, recent months have provided plenty of In two early attack ads, she's letting Trump himself, and his Republican detractors, do the work for her-without Clinton herself appearing once in either Bernie Sanders Bernie Sanders in the Democratic race ""until the last vote is cast"" The Democratic race is just about Bernie Sanders won Indiana Tuesday night, but essentially split the delegates with Hillary Clinton, who now has 92 percent of the delegates she needs for the But Sanders told ""CBS Evening News"" anchor Scott Pelley he's not going anywhere -- he's staying in the race until the very Republican Party Candidates Donald Trump Donald Trump Reaches Out, Quietly, to Republican Establishment Donald Trump, turning his attention to the general election, has begun quietly reaching out to key elements of the Republican establishment as he seeks to unite the party behind his candidacy before his anticipated battle against Hillary Trump, who is expected to run on a nonideological platform of his own design, is trying to reassure party officials that he understands there are certain norms even he needs to follow as the Republican nominee, and that he is capable of producing an organization and infrastructure that can sustain a costly general election His team, already working to transform a lean operation into a national presidential campaign apparatus, has been reaching out to members of Congress and Washington think tanks; strategizing on how best to take on Clinton and woo supporters of her primary opponent, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont; and planning to head to Cleveland next week to help direct the party's July convention, according to Donald Trump hints at changing stance on minimum wage Donald Trump suggested Wednesday that he would be open to lifting the minimum wage, switching his previous primary campaign stance that the could not afford to hike the current federal rate of $ per Asked specifically if he was ""open to raising the minimum wage"" during an interview with CNN's Wolf Blitzer, Trump responded: ""I am open to doing something with it, because I don't like "" ""But,"" he added, ""what I really do like is bring our jobs back so they're making much more than the 15 "" Ben Sasse isn't done with Donald Not Ben Sasse ( ) has said what many other GOP senators and officials undoubtedly wanted to say but have opted not to: Donald Trump could be a disaster for both the GOP and the Sasse is still the only sitting GOP senator to say he simply won't vote for Trump under any And now, even as many who labeled the now-presumptive nominee all manner of things -- including ""unstable"" and ""dangerous"" -- say they would somehow still prefer a man with those deficits to Hillary Clinton, Sasse isn't backing Thanks, Colby Moore Executive Assistant to the National Political Director Democratic National Committee O: C: user@domain [footer-d (2)]",0

"Hi everyone Let me say that I don't mind what you put in the policy makers summary if there is a general However some general discussion would be valuable . First , like Phil , I think that the supposed separation of the tree-ring reconstruction from the others on the grounds that it is not a true ""multi-proxy"" series is hard to What is true is that these particular tree-ring data best represent SUMMER temperatures mostly at the northern boreal forest By virtue of this , they also definately share significant variance with Northern Hemisphere land and land and marine ANNUAL temperatures - but at decadal and multidecadal timescales - simply by virtue of the fact that these series correlated with the former at these The multi proxy series (Mann et al . Jones et al) supposedly represent annual and summer seasons respectively, and both contain large proportions of tree-ring The latest tree-ring density curve ( our data that have been processed to retain low frequency information) shows more similarity to the other two series- as do a number of other lower resolution data ( Bradley et al, Peck et al ., and new Crowley series - see our recent Science piece) whether this represents 'TRUTH' however is a difficult I know Mike thinks his series is the 'best' and he might be right - but he may also be too dismissive of other data and possibly over confident in his (or should I say his use of other's). After all, the early ( pre-instrumental) data are much less reliable as indicators of global temperature than is apparent in modern calibrations that include them and when we don't know the precise role of particular proxies in the earlier portions of reconstruction it remains problematic to assign genuine confidence limits at multidecadal and longer I still contend that multiple regression against the recent very trendy global mean series is potentially You could calibrate the proxies to any number of seasons , regardless of their true optimum response . Not for a moment am I saying that the tree-ring , or any other proxy data, are better than Mike's series - indeed I am saying that the various reconstructions are not independent but that they likely contribute more information about reality together than they do I do believe , that it should not be taken as read that Mike's series (or Jone's et for that matter) is THE CORRECT I prefer a Figure that shows a multitude of reconstructions ( similar to that in my Science piece). Incidently, arguing that any particular series is probably better on the basis of what we now about glaciers or solar output is flaky Glacier mass balance is driven by the difference mainly in winter accumulation and summer ablation , filtered in a complex non-linear way to give variously lagged tongue advance/retreat .Simple inference on the precidence of modern day snout positions does not translate easily into absolute (or relative) temperature levels now or in the Similarly, I don't see that we are able to substantiate the veracity of different temperature reconstructions through reference to Solar forcing theories without making assumptions on the effectiveness of (seasonally specific ) long-term insolation changes in different parts of the globe and the contribution of solar forcing to the observed 20th century warming . There is still a potential problem with non-linear responses in the very recent period of some biological proxies ( or perhaps a fertilisation through high CO2 or nitrate input) . I know there is pressure to present a nice tidy story as regards 'apparent unprecedented warming in a thousand years or more in the proxy data' but in reality the situation is not quite so We don't have a lot of proxies that come right up to date and those that do (at least a significant number of tree proxies ) some unexpected changes in response that do not match the recent I do not think it wise that this issue be ignored in the For the record, I do believe that the proxy data do show unusually warm conditions in recent I am not sure that this unusual warming is so clear in the summer responsive I believe that the recent warmth was probably matched about 1000 years I do not believe that global mean annual temperatures have simply cooled progressively over thousands of years as Mike appears to and I contend that that there is strong evidence for major changes in climate over the Holocene (not Milankovich) that require explanation and that could represent part of the current or future background variability of our I think the Venice meeting will be a good place to air these Finally I appologise for this rather self-indulgent ramble, but I thought I may as well voice these points to you . I too would be happy to go through the recent draft of the chapter when it becomes cheers to all Keith",0

"Dear chapter 6 friends, I have a request on In the interest of a good and constructive working atmosphere, I would suggest that all of us focus on sober scientific arguments and refrain from unneccessarily derogatory comments about the work of I'm referring in this case to David's comment - this reference is overused, especially for such a simplistic model The reference concerned is our theory of DO events which appeared in Nature in 2001 and has since been cited 133 times according to the Web of Science (a sign of overuse?) The model concerned is the CLIMBER-2 model, featured in over 50 peer-reviewed publications since 1998, including 7 in Nature and This model is different from David's model, because it has been constructed for a differenet purpose, but it is not ""simplistic"". It would never occur to me to call David's model ""simplistic"" because it does not include an interactive continental ice sheet model, vegetation model, carbon cycle model, sediment model and isotope I'm absolutely open to any rational scientific criticism and discussion, but I can see no purpose in derogatory statements like the above, which include not even a trace of scientific This kind of thing only poisons the working atmosphere in our group, which I thought was very positive and a great pleasure in Regards, Stefan",0

Luckily for Apple, the Jailbreak community isnt so @saurik has been burning the midnight oil coding a Cydia package that will fix the holes for all devices and all firmware versions (even going back to version !). It will be released very soon, after some more testing is Since the only reason for was to fix the security holes, and since the upcoming Cydia package will fix them too (and then some!), everybody should sit tight on (or lower) and install the Cydia package as soon as its Jailbreakers can have their cake and eat it Dear Apple: youre welcome!

"Leaving aside for the moment the resolution issue, the statement should at least be consistent with our 6-10 looks like there were years around 1000 AD that could have been just as warm - if one wants to make this statement, one needs to expand the vertical scale in 6-10 to show that the current warm period is 'warmer'. Now getting back to the resolution issue: given what we know about the ability to reconstruct global or NH temperatures in the past - could we really in good conscience say we have the precision from tree rings and the very sparse other data to make any definitive statement of this nature (let alone accuracy)? While I appreciate the cleverness of the second sentence, the problem is everybody will recognize that we are 'being clever' - at what point does one come out looking aggressively defensive? I agree that leaving the first sentence as the only sentence suggests that one is somehow doubting the significance of the recent warm years, which is probably not something we want to What I would suggest is to forget about making 'one year' assessments; what 6-10 shows is that the recent warm period is highly anomalous with respect to the record of the last 1000 That would be what I think we can safely conclude the last 1000 years really tells David",0

I suggest to review completely the text, so that we can correct this before sending it to , I am seeing that you are changing the prices of the modulesand for this, I would do a different approach(meaning Im not OK with it :-))I suggest not to change the price It should be The price list and the price for each module cannot be changed to the benefit of one specific customer / market, etcOtherwise, it is like having NO price I suggest is to maintain the same price AND provide discounts in order to adapt to specific customer / market This approach has the advantage of keeping the same price list AND adapting to specific You also gain Customer by providing him a discount (he should be happy), and not putting your price for instance:the Master Node should stay always at 220KIf you want to propose it for 150K, then you leave the price of 220K in the table and you should put a discount at the end of the table (before the total) of - 70K, in order to arrive to the same amount of 150KSame for the Collectors: 2 are priced 140K, so 1 collector should be 70K minimum or even 80K, because you only purchase oneIf you want to propose the price of 60K, then it is a -10K additional discount at the anonymizers should be 50K, not 30K, because 6 anonymizers are 100KAnd so on for the Console, the Physical Vectors, the 10 concurrent agents, etcIn summary, we should have only one price list ! it has to be Then we create specific configurations for specific customer, and we can adapt providing specific discountsSo for RAB, the price list of their system should be kept at around or above (depending of the module) the price of790K - 160K discount 630 (if you want to keep this price for the customer).In the table you can add a line of SUBTOTAL, then add a line of SPECIAL DISCOUNT, then complete the line of same for the Professional Provide a discount instead of changing the dont mind if the discount is hugeOur price list should be high, even if our proposal are at a lower priceYou gain from positioning high price AND providing discounts (even before negotiations).I really insist here ! this is pure marketing positioning and pricing need to be extremely coherent and disciplined in this for this long But time difference doesnt help Let me know if my email was sufficiently Im available tomorrow early morning if you want to Vinci Le 21 2015 18:13, Marco Bettini a crit :Daniel,",0

"By Ben White | 05/03/2016 08:00 AM EDT TED'S LAST STAND - Sure looks like Texas Senator Ted Cruz's last presidential rodeo on Tuesday in Cruz himself marked it as must win and polls suggest he will lose and perhaps That's likely to bring his campaign to an end and ensure a first ballot nomination of Donald Trump in really can't believe we just typed that Donald Trump will be the Republican Party's nominee for president of the United Let it sink The guy who fired people for a living on a reality TV show, called Mexican immigrants rapists and murderers, wants to build a giant wall with Mexico (somehow paid for by Mexicans), wants to block Muslims from entering the United States, has no understanding of how international trade actually works, said Hillary Clinton would only get 5% of the vote if she didn't play the ""woman card"" and has no apparent interest in learning any actual facts about critical policy issues facing the This man will have a chance to be president of the United Granted, it's not a very good But at this point who really knows? Even many of the assorted senators, governors, CEOs, foreign leaders and other potentates gathered out here at the Milken Conference in Los Angeles think there is at least a 25% chance that Trump could The general hope here is that if that happens, Trump will jettison the angry stuff he heard on talk radio and used to win the GOP nomination and actually surround himself with serious policy experts and run a responsible If that doesn't happen the best case would likely be a national embarrassment and the worst case a global SPEAKING OF MILKEN If you'd like to see me talk Trump, Clinton, debt, deficit and tax reform with Senators Mark Warner ( ) and David Perdue ( ) along with Ernst & Young CEO Mark Weinberger and the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget's Maya MacGuineas, you can do so here: FROMAN ON TPP - also did a session with US Trade Representative Michael Froman who reiterated his confidence that TPP will pass the current Congress - likely in the lame duck session - given that it has the support of both the House Speaker and the Senate Majority leader and can't be Froman wouldn't say it but the general belief is that if the lame duck can't send TPP to Obama it could be dead for In Froman's very careful and on message way he suggested the current favorable window for TPP may not be open for all that No question about Trump has castigated the deal and Clinton - after initially supporting it very strongly - now says she opposes Clinton would take massive heat from labor unions and other core constituencies early in her presidency if she moved quickly on The best scenario for Clinton is for the lame duck to approve TPP so she wouldn't have to deal with it in OBAMA ON TPP - President Obama in a WP op-ed: ""Today, some of our greatest economic opportunities abroad are in the Asia-Pacific region Increasing trade in this area of the world would be a boon to American businesses and American workers, and it would give us a leg up on our economic competitors, including one we hear a lot about on the campaign trail these days: China ""Of course, China's greatest economic opportunities also lie in its own neighborhood, which is why China is not wasting any As we speak, China is negotiating a trade deal that would carve up some of the fastest-growing markets in the world at our expense, putting American jobs, businesses and goods at If we don't get the TPP done, American goods will continue to face high tariffs and other trade barriers in the region"" BERNIE HOPES TO HOLD ON - POLITICO's Daniel Strauss: ""Indiana won't have a dramatic effect on Bernie Sanders' fortunes - win or lose, he's said he's fighting on through the But a win Tuesday would be a much-needed respite from a week of headlines suggesting his campaign is sputtering and his path to the nomination is all but First came news of hundreds of staff Then came word that his April fundraising had declined considerably compared to March - his haul dropped from $44 million to $26 ""The Northeastern primaries were unkind to him as well: Hillary Clinton won four of five states last This week, though, all evidence points to a nail-biter in Tuesday's only Sanders has barnstormed the Indiana college campus Clinton has worked the state's biggest cities, hoping to lock down the African-American She's got strong support from the state's top Democrats, but Sanders has an ace-in-the-hole: Indiana's open primary format"" GOOD TUESDAY MORNING - Thanks for all the great restaurant The better half and I had an amazing dinner at Gracias Madre, an entirely organic and vegan Mexican place on Sounds so right?

Very funny, very colorful and nobody will be disappointed despite of the fact that the bar set by the previous chapter is really Weve got a great concept with Hotel T and we are so happy that thitos new script is so It is not just that the movie has many very funny jokes and flashbacks that will make it appealing to both kids and parents, it is also that this script sets a really good and rich playground to develop a strong marketing concepts to sell the movie: The cohabitation between monsters and humans: exploit the contrast between us and How to become a good Vamp: Vamps Camp to teach you how to become a How to improve your performance, blood tasting, The babysitting grandparents ( so much in use lately!): many grandparents will be reflected into this Since they spend so much time with their grandchildren, they really want to educate them the way they want to, even if that means to do it against the kids parent we want to go back to what we did in the first chapter and widely use the local voices ( Social media driven) that worked so well previously and probably add a new local voice for Mortem: HOTEL T 1: o What were the strongest elements of the brand in your territory? HT1 is extremely fun and intelligent and we had to be have to be very careful with the new film, it has to be as intelligent as the previous one including jokes for adult Did you have creative assets that allowed you the flexibility to properly exploit the brand for your campaign? Yes, we had everything we We have to keep the materials focused on the main characters, those who are known for everyone: Dracula, Frankenstein, Mummy o Considering all dimensions (trailers, TV spots, digital, promotions, ), what aspects of your campaign for HOTEL T 1 were most successful? All the materials were really cool, but we think that trailers and print campaign were o What aspects were least successful? Would you have done them differently or not at all? What were the learnings? We need creative in-theatre materials with enough These are some very good examples: Kinepolis_gru: Cinesa_gru: Cinesa Christmas_gru: o Who were your promotional partners? Our promotional partners were Granini, Santander, Burger King, El Corte Ingls, Neck&Neck, Puma and o Was the voice talent accessible to you for publicity?

"Trump hammering out party fundraising agreement By Kenneth Vogel, Eli Stokols and Alex Isenstadt 05/09/2016 05:26 PM EDT Donald Trump's campaign is hashing out the details of an agreement with Republican Party leaders that could allow the presumptive GOP presidential nominee to raise six-figure checks for his presidential campaign, multiple sources with direct knowledge of the negotiations tell The fundraising agreement was among the subjects discussed at a Monday meeting at the Republican National Committee's Washington offices between top RNC officials, including chairman Reince Priebus, and senior Trump aides, including campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, senior adviser Paul Manafort and political director Rick Wiley, according to the The talks represent the first formal steps towards a merger between the official apparatus of the Republican Party and a candidate who many party leaders scorned until recently, and about whom there remains deep leeriness in some Republican Since Trump essentially clinched the GOP nomination with a win in last week's Indiana primary, his staff has moved quickly to put their stamp on the party's general election planning Wiley has paid several visits to the party's headquarters on Capitol Hill to assess its efforts, according to the The campaign also has been discussing convention-related issues with the RNC, including credentials and rules, the sources And deputy campaign manager Michael Glassner this week is set to lead a delegation to the convention site, Cleveland's Quicken Loans Arena, to receive a briefing from RNC officials involved in planning for the July event, as POLITICO first reported last Fundraising was not a major focus of Monday's meetings, according to RNC senior strategist Sean ""It was 3 ½ hours on briefings from all the RNC divisions regarding the capabilities and resources that we have been compiling to win in November,"" said Spicer, who attended the The conversations are also partly an effort to lay the groundwork for a Thursday meeting in Washington between Trump, Priebus and House Speaker Paul Ryan, who announced last Thursday that he is withholding his endorsement until Trump outlines a stronger commitment to conservative The perception among Trump's inner circle is that Ryan is attempting to leverage his position as chairman of the Cleveland convention into securing a deal that protects the party's control over vendor contracts and how the money raised jointly by the party and Trump's campaign is ""Trump is a tough negotiator, understands the history of what he's entitled to here,"" another Trump confidant ""They want the RNC to be autonomous but they'll work with the Trump They need Trump to help raise the money but they want their vendors to be the ones to spend the "" But Trump may be more reliant on the national party than past presidential nominees, since his campaign has invested relatively little in field staff, voter data or a fundraising Some of Trump's infrastructure deficiencies can be traced to his unwillingness to dig deep into his own fortune to finance his campaign, which he has pledged from the beginning to Entering into a joint fundraising agreement and leaning on the party for cash and staff would help fill that void, but also could undermine his rhetoric about being independent from the party's donor To view online: To change your alert settings, please go to or email was sent to user@domain by: POLITICO, LLC 1000 Wilson Arlington, VA, 22209, USA To unsubscribe,",0

Here are some references to recent Holocene time-frame records you probably have seen, but just in I found them interesting without knowing how good or representative they Surprisingly they were given me by one who cited them as examples of evidence for a MWP and I read them differently but they caused me to consider one question I hadn't heard discussed (see below). Based just on these four, one comes to the following tentative conclusions and observations: Conclusions: MWP was a generally warm time interspersed with coolings and not well synchronized hemispherically or LIA was global and capable of better (but not completely) synchronized large amplitude variations 20th was the only time when all records agree (tree ring problems with CO2?) MIGHT THIS RELATIVE UNIFORMITY BE USED AS A CHARACTERISTIC OF 20TH CENTU WARMING THAT SETS IT APART FROM PREVIOUS CLIMATE CHANGES? Borehole inversion is too smoothed to be of much use but it does indicate a larger temp amplitude if it weren't ~ And this brings up my How one averages these One way would be to note that the temperature amplitude (1000 - 1950) for each is ~ Thus you could conclude that hemispheric/global climate varied ay over a degree Celcius (although with regional differences) Another way would be to average the The resulting temperature amplitude would be smaller because extremes would cancel since variability is large and each region's extremes occur at different Thus, if people simply looked at several records they would get the impression that temperature variations were large, ~ Imagine their surprise when they see that the ensemble averages you publish have much smaller Comparison of amplitudes is given below (although difficult to do since amplitude depends on averaging so these are very approximate). Approximate Temperature Amplitudes for period 1000-1950 Mann et al 1999 ~ Jones et al 1998 ~ Crowley and Lowery ??? Briffa 2000 ??? Dahl, Jensen ~ Huang, et al ~ (500 yrs only) Overpeck et al ~ (400 yrs, polar only) Bradley & Jones(93) ~ (600 yrs only) (Not surprising that the contrarians take great exception to Michael's small ) This is important in the current debate even, it would appear, with people like I have been looking for what the real issue is between researchers like yourselves and skeptical Politics and agendas aside, I think it is close to Anyone looking at the records gets the impression that the temperature amplitude for many individual records/sites over the past 1000 years or so is often larger than They thus recognize that natural variability is unlikely to generate such large changes unless the sun is having more effect than direct forcing, or there is some fortuitous but detectable combination of And they see this as evidence that the or so temperature rise in the 20th century is not all that The community, however, in making ensemble averages gets a much smaller amplitude ~ which they say shows that reasonable combinations of solar direct plus volcanos and internal variability with the help of THC can indeed explain this AND the 20th century warming is Thus, the impass--one side pointing to large temperature variations in many records around the globe and the other saying ""yes, but not synchronous and so averaged hemispherically no big But, just replying that lack of synchronous events (sometimes by a few decades) is the reason might not be It seems to me that we must go one step We must address the question: what forcings can generate large amplitude temperature variations over hundreds of years, regional though they may be (and, could these occur at different times in different regions due to shifting heat inertia patterns)? If we can't do this, then there might be something wrong with our rationale that the average is low amplitude even though many regions see high This may be the nubbin of the disagreement, and until we answer it, many careful scientists will decide the issue is still unsettled and that indeed climate in the past may well have varied as much or more than in the last hundred (Also, I note that most proxy temperature records claim timing errors of +-50 years or What is the possibility that records are cancelling each other out on variations in the hundred year frame due simply to timing errors? as in hitting or missing C&L's triple warming peak 1000-1200 AD) Regards, Referendes to proxy temp records (1) Bodri, and Climate change of the last millennium inferred from borehole temperatures: Regional patterns of climatic changes in the Czech Republic - Part III, Global and Planetary Change, 21, 1999 As with other borehole data the record is incredibly It has essentially three warming from 1000 to after 1500 there is a broad warming pulse; 1550-1750 cooling 1750-1850 warming 1850-1900 cooling 1900-1950? rapid warming Total amplitude ~1C ( if not smoothed?)

"Thanks Phil, (Tom: Congrats again!) The Soon & Baliunas paper couldn't have cleared a 'legitimate' peer review process That leaves only one possibility--that the peer-review process at Climate Research has been hijacked by a few skeptics on the editorial And it isn't just De Frietas, unfortunately I think this group also includes a member of my own The skeptics appear to have staged a 'coup' at ""Climate Research"" (it was a mediocre journal to begin with, but now its a mediocre journal with a definite 'purpose'). Folks might want to check out the editors and review editors: [1] In fact, Mike McCracken first pointed out this article to me, and he and I have discussed this a I've cc'd Mike in on this as well, and I've included Peck I told Mike that I believed our only choice was to ignore this They've already achieved what they wanted--the claim of a peer-reviewed There is nothing we can do about that now, but the last thing we want to do is bring attention to this paper, which will be ignored by the community on the It is pretty clear that thee skeptics here have staged a bit of a coup, even in the presence of a number of reasonable folks on the editorial board (Whetton, Goodess, ). My guess is that Von Storch is actually with them (frankly, he's an odd individual, and I'm not sure he isn't himself somewhat of a skeptic himself), and without Von Storch on their side, they would have a very forceful personality promoting their new There have been several papers by Pat Michaels, as well as the Soon & Baliunas paper, that couldn't get published in a reputable This was the danger of always criticising the skeptics for not publishing in the ""peer-reviewed literature"". Obviously, they found a solution to that--take over a journal! So what do we do about this? I think we have to stop considering ""Climate Research"" as a legitimate peer-reviewed Perhaps we should encourage our colleagues in the climate research community to no longer submit to, or cite papers in, this We would also need to consider what we tell or request of our more reasonable colleagues who currently sit on the editorial What do others think? mike",0

"Hi Grant, I have been tied up with other In looking at the paper some 1) In Fig 1, why is the scale zero to 2? Normally a filter would be scaled to have a response function zero to 2) In Fig 2 and 3 what are the units of ""power""? It is not in the Are these normalized spectra so that the area under the curve is unity? My guess is that this is the case and hence the amplification at ENSO But it is important to say this and perhaps point Maybe the captions are sufficient? Add something like: The spectra have been normalized to have unit variance, which relatively inflates the values in the to frequency In a couple of places in text add ""normalized"" before ""power spectrum"" such as 2 lines above Fig 3 in the JGR set 3) A minor point: in the x sin(2 pi vt) I would be inclined to add an amplitude which would then be included also in eq (1) on RHS emphasizing how the amplitude is [My own preference would be to call the amplitude A and the A you have R (for response function)]. However it is fine as Thanks Kevin",0

"Mike, Presumably you've seen all this - the forwarded email from I got this email from McIntyre a few days As far as I'm concerned he has the data - sent ages I'll tell him this, but that's all - no If I can find it, it is likely to be hundreds of lines of uncommented fortran ! I recall the program did a lot more that just average the I know why he can't replicate the results early on - it is because there was a variance correction for fewer See you in Cheers Phil Dear Phil, In keeping with the spirit of your suggestions to look at some of the other multiproxy publications, I've been looking at Jones et al [1998]. The methodology here is obviously more straightforward than However, while I have been able to substantially emulate your calculations, I have been unable to do so The differences are larger in the early Since I have been unable to replicate the results exactly based on available materials, I would appreciate a copy of the actual data set used in Jones et al [1998] as well as the code used in these There is an interesting article on replication by Anderson et , some distinguished economists, here [1] discussing the issue of replication in applied economics and referring favorably to our attempts in respect to Regards, Steve McIntyre X-Mailer: QUALCOMM Windows Eudora Version Date: Tue, 26 Apr 2005 13:28:53 +0100 To: Phil Jones ,""Keith Briffa"" From: Tim Osborn Subject: Fwd: CCNet: DEBUNKING THE ""DANGEROUS CLIMATE CHANGE"" SCARE Keith and Phil, you both feature in the latest issue of CCNet: (4) GLOBAL WARMING AND DATA Steve Verdon, Outside the Beltway, 25 April 2005 [2] A new paper ([3] ) from the Luis Federal Reserve Bank has an interesting paer on how important it is to archive not only the data but the code for empirical While the article looks mainly at economic research there is also a lesson to be drawn from this paper about the current state of research for global warming/climate One of the hallmarks of scientific research is that the results can be Without this, the results shouldn't be considered valid let alone used for making Ideally, investigators should be willing to share their data and programs so as to encourage other investigators to replicate and/or expand on their Such behavior allows science to move forward in a Kuhn-style linear fashion, with each generation seeing further from the shoulders of the previous At a minimum, the results of an endeavor-if it is to be labeled ""scientific""-should be replicable, , another researcher using the same methods should be able to reach the same In the case of applied economics using econometric software, this means that another researcher using the same data and the same computer software should achieve the same However, this is precisely the problem that Steven McIntyre and Ross McKitrick have run into since looking into the methodology used by Mann, Hughes and Bradely (1998) (MBH98), the paper that came up with the famous ""hockey stick"" for temperature For example, this post here shows that McIntyre was prevented from accessing Mann's FTP This is supposedly a public site where interested researchers can download not only the source code, but also the This kind of behavior by Mann is simply unscientific and also rather Why lock out a researcher who is trying to verify your you have something to hide professors Mann, Bradley and Huges? Not only has this been a problem has this been a problem for McIntyre with regards to MBH98, but other studies as This post at Climate Audit shows that this problem is actually quite Crowley and Lowery (2000) After nearly a year and over 25 emails, Crowley said in mid-October that he has misplaced the original data and could only find transformed and smoothed This makes proper data checking impossible, but I'm planning to do what I can with what he Do I need to comment on my attitude to the original data being ""misplaced""? Briffa et (2001) There is no listing of sites in the article or SI (despite JGR policies requiring citations be limited to publicly archived data). Briffa has refused to respond to any requests for None of these guys have the least interest in some one going through their data and seem to hoping that the demands wither I don't see how any policy reliance can be made on this paper with no available Esper et (2002) This paper is usually thought to show much more variation than the hockey Esper has listed the sites used, but most of them are not Esper has not responded to any requests for ' Jones and Mann (2003); Mann and Jones (2004) Phil Jones sent me data for these studies in July 2004, but did not have the weights used in the calculations, which Mann Jones thought that the weights did not matter, but I have found I've tried a few times to get the weights, but so far have been My surmise is that the weighting in these papers is based on correlations to local temperature, as opposed to MBH98-MBH99 where the weightings are based on correlations to the temperature PC1 (but this is just speculation right ) The papers do not describe the methods in sufficient detail to permit Jacoby and d'Arrigo (northern treeline) I've got something quite interesting in progress If you look at the original 1989 paper, you will see that Jacoby ""cherry-picked"" the 10 ""most temperature-sensitive"" sites from 36 I've done simulations to emulate cherry-picking from persistent red noise and consistently get hockey stick shaped series, with the Jacoby northern treeline reconstruction being indistinguishable from simulated hockey The other 26 sites have not been I've written to Climatic Change to get them to intervene in getting the Jacoby has refused to provide the He says that his research is ""mission-oriented"" and, as an ex-marine, he is only interested in a ""few good"" Jacoby has also carried out updated studies on the Gasp series, so essential to I've seen a chronology using the new data, which looks completely different from the old data (which is a hockey stick). I've asked for the new data, but Jacoby-d'Arrigo have refused it saying that the old data is ""better"" for showing temperature Need I comment? I've repeatedly asked for the exact location of the Gasp site for nearly 9 months now (I was going to privately fund a re-sampling program, but Jacoby, Cook and others have refused to disclose the ) Need I comment? Jones et al (1998) Phil Jones stands alone among paleoclimate authors, as a diligent I have data and methods from Jones et al I have a couple of concerns here, which I'm working I remain concerned about the basis of series selection - there is an obvious risk of ""cherrypicking"" data and I'm very unclear what steps, if any, were taken to avoid The results for the middle ages don't look robust to I have particular concerns with Briffa's Polar Urals series, which takes the 11th century results down (Briffa arguing that 1032 was the coldest year of the millennium). It looks to me like the 11th century data for this series does not meet quality control criteria and Briffa was Without this series, Jones et 1998 is high in the 11th Note that none of this actually ""disproves"" the global warming However, it does raise very, very serious questions in my We are talking about enacting policies to curb global warming that could cost not billions, but trillions of Shouldn't we at least be allowed to see the source code, the data and ask for replication at a minimum?

"Dear Mike, (and interested colleagues) Given the list of people to whom you have chosen to circulate your message(s), we thought we should make a short, somewhat formal, response I am happy to reserve my informal response until we are face to face! We did not respond earlier because we had more pressing tasks to deal This is not the place to go into a long or over-detailed response to all of your comments but a few brief remarks might help to clear up a couple of You consider our commentary on Ed and Jan's paper ""more flawed than even the paper itself"" on the basis that scaling the relationship between full Northern Hemisphere and extratropical Northern Hemisphere is much more problematic than even any of the seasonal issues we In fact we did not do The curve labelled Mann99 in our figure was, in fact, based on the average of only the land areas, north of 20 degrees N, extracted from your spatially-resolved We then scaled it by calibration against the instrumental annual temperatures from the same This is, just as you stress in your comments on the Esper et paper, what should have been We think that this single point addresses virtually of all your We can, of course, argue about what this means for the pre-1400 part of your reconstruction, when only 1 EOF was reconstructed, but the essential message is that we did our best to exclude the tropics (and the oceans too!) from your series so that it could more readily be compared with the other The fact that we have used only the extra-tropical land from your data is not clear from the text, so we can see why you may not have appreciated this, but we think you will concede that this fact negates much of what you say and that we acted ""more correctly"" than you Blame Science for being so mean with their space allocation if you want! Remember that this was an unrefereed piece and we felt justified in concentrating on one issue; that of the importance of the method of scaling and its effect on apparent ""absolute"" reconstruction In our draft, we went on to say that this was crucial for issues of simple model sensitivity studies and climate detection, citing the work of Tom Crowley and Myles Allen, but this fell foul of the editor's You also express concerns about the calibration of Esper et ( , you say ""if the authors had instead used the actual (unsmoothed) instrumental record for the extratropical northern hemisphere to scale their record, their reconstruction would be much closer to MBH99""). This point is wholly consistent with our discussion in the perspective piece, and indeed we show that in absolute terms the records are closer when Esper et is calibrated using unsmoothed data but since the variance is also reduced, the significance of the differences may be just as Finally, we have to say that we do not feel constrained in what we say to the media or write in the scientific or popular press, by what the sceptics will say or do with our We can only strive to do our best and address the issues Some ""sceptics"" have their own dishonest agenda - we have no doubt of If you believe that I, or Tim, have any other objective but to be open and honest about the uncertainties in the climate change debate, then I am disappointed in you Best regards Keith (and Tim)",0

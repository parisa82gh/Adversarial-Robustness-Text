"Hi Phil - thanks for your detailed reply to my I look forward to working with you and the rest of the gang to really improve the state of paleo contributions to the detection/attribution The earlier we get a small group together, the better, so I suggest we try to take you up on the AMS add-on It would be ideal to have a 1 to mtg in Boulder since we have many of the needed perspectives (ice core, coral, seds, data, etc) What would be the best dates for you (and Keith - I'm hoping he'll be up for this too). We can find the extra $$ to get folks to Boulder and have a quality time (do you ski?). Once we set the dates with you (PLEASE SEND FAVORED DATES), Mike and Ray, we can set the The main thing is that it would set the stage for the extra degree of data sharing we'll need before the planned Santorini mtg (still no dates - please bug Jean-Claude!!). Sound ok? As for the data from your paper, I'd like to get them up with the data from the other studies on the WDC www site (JUST LET ME KNOW HOW!) The White House is interested in knowing the state-of-the-art, and if we can get everything together at one www site (including data and figs), I think I can get some needed visibility for the paleo You probably know this, but Henry Pollack's Borehole view of things (similar conclusions to the other recent papers) is about to appear in Although each proxy and method does have it's limitations and biases, the multiproxy view is compelling with regard to the patterns of temp change over the past several The IPCC next time around should be much stronger than last on the paleo side of things (although still not as good as it can get!). Of course, I'll continue to work with Mike and Ray to get the rest of the individual series out into the public Santorini should be the goal - not alowwed on the island without coughing up data first!

"FLDS Court Update: By Donald Richter A unanimous decision by the Texas Third Court of Appeals in Austin on May 22, 2008, was a resounding victory for the FLDS people and a vindication of the position that we have taken since the YFZ community was raided last The Court said that there was no evidence of an \93immediate\94 or \93urgent\94 danger justifying the removal of the children and directed the district court to vacate its decision giving CPS custody of the The Court of Appeals will issue a writ of mandamus \93if the district court fails to comply with this \94 The Court ruled that \93the evidence adduced at the hearing held April 17-18, 2008, was legally and factually insufficient to maintain custody of Relator 's children with the Consequently, the district court abused its discretion in failing to return the Relator 's children to the \94 While the appellate decision only immediately affects the children of 38 mothers in whose behalf the ruling was made, an Associated Press release on May 22, 2008, said that attorneys for the other parents are expected to seek for their clients to be included in the The appellate court found that the state was wrong to consider the entire YFZ community as a single household and to proceed on the basis of guilt by The following is stated in footnote 10 of the ruling: \93The notion that the entire ranch community constitutes a \91household ' as contemplated by section and justifies removing all children from the ranch community if there even is one incident of suspected child sexual abuse is contrary to the The Department 's witnesses acknowledged that the ranch community was divided into separate family groups and separate While there was evidence that the living arrangements on the ranch are more communal than most typical neighborhoods, the evidence was not legally or factually sufficient to support a theory that the entire ranch community was a \91household ' \94 The ruling also indicates that the entire action was based on religious prejudice just as the FLDS people have been claiming all CPS consistently has referred to the \93pervasive belief system\94 of the FLDS people as justification for taking custody of the The Court of Appeals ruled as follows: \93The Department did not present any evidence of danger to the physical health or safety of any male children or any female children who had not reached Nor did the Department offer any evidence that any of Relator 's pubescent female children were in physical danger other than that those children live at the ranch among a group of people who have a \91pervasive system of belief ' that condones polygamous marriage and underage females having children The existence of the FLDS belief system as described by the Department 's witnesses, by itself, does not put children of FLDS parents in physical \94 . While it is not the case that the FLDS Church teaches that underage marriage is part of our religious belief, the above quotations do clearly show that given the absence of any evidence of physical danger to children, the state 's actions were indeed a direct attack on the FLDS Furthermore, in the \93individual\94 hearings which have been in session this week, CPS already has acknowledged that most of its underage mothers actually are As the implications of the Court of Appeals decision become apparent, we acknowledge first the blessings of our benevolent Heavenly Father in answering our prayers and the prayers of thousands of other honest-hearted people We also express our thanks to the Judges of the Third Court of Appeals, to Julie Balovich of the Texas RioGrande Legal Aid group, and to all of the other attorneys who have been working so hard to obtain justice for the FLDS We know that much remains to be done before the families are reunited, but the process is finally ",0

"Janice, Most of the data series in most of the plots have just appeared on the CRU web Go to data then to Did this to stop getting hassled by the skeptics for the data Mike Mann refuses to talk to these people and I can understand They are just trying to find if we've done anything I sent one of them loads of series and he barely said a It seems they are now going for Tom Crowley, Lonnie Thompson and Gordon Jacoby as most of their series are not on web Below is a link to an awful piece by He told me he is a writing a paper, but wrote the press release first ! The pdf is worth getting for a couple of sentences, when he said that MJ restricted their use of paleo series to those that had correlations with instrumental data ! It is a 'Our uncertainty estimates are based solely on how well the proxy records match the observed data' ! The Legates piece must have been sent to loads of environment correspondents across the world and a number of op-ed pieces Some were Most have had responses from Ray Bradley, Caspar Amman and Hope all is well with you and all the best to Glad you enjoyed the Cheers Phil PS Do you want to get involved in IPCC this time? I'm the CLA of the atmospheric chapter with Kevin Trenberth and we'll be looking for Contributing Authors to help the Lead Authors we Paleo is in a different section this time led by Peck and Eystein Keith is a lead author as Phil Jones has made a valid point in that some of the articles cited in my critique do not 'directly' address problems with Mann and Jones (MJ) but rather, address problems with earlier works by Mann, Bradley, and Hughes (MBH) and other Fair enough - I have changed the critique to reflect that The revised version has been posted since July 19 at: [1] However, I still contend that most of my original arguments - namely, the problems with the shaft, blade, and sheath - apply equally to Mann and Jones as well as the other Mann et manifestations of the 'hockey stick'. MJ incorporate data from a number of the same sources as those used by MBH; for example, Mann's unpublished PC1 from the western North American tree-ring data, Cook's Tasmanian tree rings, Thompson's Quelccaya and Dunde ice core oxygen isotope records (the latter embedded in Yang's Chinese composite), and Fisher's stacked Greenland ice core oxygen isotope Calibration and verification of MJ includes the flawed MBH Thus, any errors in MBH effectively undermine the calibration-verification results of MJ, leaving this study unsupported and any problems with the underlying common proxies identified in critiques of MBH will also result in identical problems in My criticism regarding the blade is that deg C warming for the last century is noted by the IPCC whereas MJ (and other M et al representations) have up to deg C warming in their observed See MJ's figure 2 where for the global and NH reconstruction, their estimates for 2000 exceed + and + (nearly + ), MJ's NH curve is included in the attached Thus, I stand by my criticism of MJ on this point, which is more egregious in MJ than other M et al From Jones: ""The trend over the 20th century in the Figure and in the instrumental IPCC quotes deg C over the 1901-2000 Fact - but Legates is eyeballing the curve to get deg A figure isn't given in Mann and Jones (2003). Take it from me the trend is about the same as the instrumental "" Funny, but there IS a figure in MJ - see their Figure As for me 'eyeballing' an apparently non-existent curve, I attach a figure from Soon et (2004) that contains a portion of MJ's Figure 2 to allow others to decide for themselves whether MJ suggest a twentieth century warming of deg C or deg Moreover, maybe someone can explain why every time Mann and his colleagues draft another curve, the temperature in 2000 gets warmer and warmer after the My criticisms regarding the sheath (largely from a paper on which I am working) stem from the characterization of the uncertainty by MJ that arises solely from the 'fit' statistics to the 1600-1855 period using cross-validation with, not observations, but composites of three previously compiled reconstructions, including that developed by MBH - the focus of known flaws and errors in the Note that some of the same data are used in both MBH and MJ, which doesn't allow for a truly independent My rather obvious point was not that fit statistics should not be included (as Jones asserts) but that MJ included no errors in either input realization (observations or proxy data) or other obvious sources of The claim by MBH and MJ is that only the model lack-of-fit contributes to uncertainty is inherently Considerable errors exist in the representation of both fields - annual temperatures from both observations and proxy records - and must be Clearly, there is a spatial bias associated with observations that are biased away from the oceans, high latitudes, and high The spatial problem is far more pronounced when only a handful of proxies are used to represent the global temperatures at earlier time Both MBH and MJ are equally guilty in this David Legates",0

Fortunately I read about it in the The newspaper had a front page story the following Monday and a whole page of pictures I confessed I did not attend the Immigration reform is a serious issue, but this event was organized by a man who identified himself as a sympathizer with the National Socialist Whenever I want to learn more about immigration reform, I avoid listening t o members of that I don t know what they could add to the The Herald s account, one that I can now view as a reader of the paper searching for the truth, reported confrontations between people, estimated the crowd at 100 people and displayed pictures showing people pointing fingers, faces contorted, mouths open and hand-made Obviously, the Herald thought the immigration reform rally organized by a self-avowed National Socialist Movement member was important enough to meri t the extensive The other news coverage that caused me to take pause was a headline Chas e subject in Freeborn County The headline said it I didn t have to read the When deputie s must chase a prisoner in the nearly new Freeborn County Jail, it s the en d of civilization, as I know I just hope the Mower County commissioners saw that story, too and are taking steps to insure that won t happen in our new county There are hundreds of offenders waiting to move into the new facility being built in downtown Once they re in jail, prisoners should stay in their air-conditioned cells watching cable TV, reading girlie magazines, calling friends on cell phones smuggled into the jail on visiting day, surfing the internet for new Facebook friends or waiting for a trip to the dentist, eye clinic or hospital to have a doctor take a look at that back ache suffered crawling out a window during a burglary There should be no need to chase subjects in jail enjoying the accommodations provided by And don t get me started about seeing that woman s obituary photo next to the young couple s engagement photo the other Putting an obituary n ext to an engagement is awkward to say the I also read Chicago Sun-Times columnist Neil Steinberg s July 6 effort headlined Hamming it up at Spam The columnist began by recounting his visit to Johnny s Main Event restaurant and the less than satisfactory Next, he crossed North Main Street and visited the As far as humility, well, I ve never been to a corporate museum that s aid so many unenthusiastic things about its product, such as Eating Spam is better than eating bugs uttered by a life-sized video of a fatigue-clad The columnist writes a less than flattering account of visiting what is to Austin a sacred In closing he suggests he received a lack-luster sales job on other local attractions and claimed the museum staff suggested he could stay at a Holiday Inn in Austin or Wellington Wellington?

PDT on Thursday, July 30, 2009 By JOHN ASBURY The Press-Enterprise Fueled by anger over the economy, immigration and the election of President Barack Obama, white supremacists have been increasing in number in the Inland region and throughout California during the past year, local and national experts The Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks hate activity, reports 84 known hate groups in The 2 state, Texas, has About a dozen of those groups are in the Inland area, including Riverside, Hemet, San Bernardino and Temecula, according to the In the past year, a new chapter of the National Socialist Movement -- a sec t of the largest neo-Nazi group in the country -- started in Riverside, according to Riverside County sheriff's investigators and the Anti-Defamation The group has not been tied to criminal activity in the Inland area, authorities Story continues below Cli ck to enlarge ""If you look at the election of the first black president and the state of the economy being what it is today, with unemployment at an all-time high, these types of things are kind of a perfect storm for these feelings to foment and for white supremacists to feel validated,"" said Joanna Mendelson , California investigative researcher for the Anti-Defamation League, a civil rights advocacy In addition to concerns about membership going up, Inland agencies are seeing a few of the groups become more sophisticated and violent, developin g criminal organizations that don't just target minorities but are also branching into drugs and weapons Those activities are easier t o conceal in remote regions like some parts of the Inland area, said Mendelso n and Inland Statistics on hate crimes committed and charges filed remain The most recent state attorney general's office report was based on crimes committed in But Inland police and sheriff's investigators and national experts point to a number of factors -- including recent violent attacks and a rise in hate propaganda online -- as evidence that hate activity is on the rise Local law enforcement agencies are stepping up efforts to monitor hate groups such as racist skinhead organizations, which commonly adopt Aryan or new-Nazi beliefs and target people of certain races and The goal is to put violent offenders in prison and stop criminal groups before they gain too much For example, seven members of a Hemet skinhead group have been arrested in the November beating of a Hispanic man, described by Hemet police as backlash against Obama's San Bernardino County authorities say they dismantled a large skinhead organization this year that they suspect was involved in multiple murders and In addition to the skinhead and neo-Nazi groups on the Southern Poverty Law Center's list of Inland Southern California hate groups, the center include s a border security organization, an anti-gay religious group and a black separatist group, which may be deemed intolerant but are not linked to crim e or Brian Levin, director of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at Cal State San Bernardino, said he believes the Inland area has the largest number of hate groups in the United ""When you look at the sheer number of groups in the Inland Empire to begin with, it is significant,"" he BREEDING GROUND Law enforcement officials say the Inland area follows the pattern of other areas on the outskirts of larger cities, where hate groups pop up amid a ""white flight"" migration out of cities and suburbs that have become more developed and ""Southern California is a prime location for recruiting of white supremacis t gang members,"" Hemet police Detective Bob Nishida ""They're looking fo r the type of people with neo-Nazi beliefs, and for this area, generally speaking, there's a lot of people with those same "" Though most of California's skinheads are not affiliated with any groups, the Inland area is an ""Since the election, we've seen an increased drive for groups to unite unde r one flag,"" said San Bernardino County sheriff's Deputy Eric In remote regions such as the High Desert, skinhead groups are more frequently holding ""unityfests"" -- joint meetings between different organizations to merge forces and have the potential to plan criminal activity, he Authorities see such rallies as an effort to become more violent and instill fear into the ""It makes more sense for them to act as a unit,"" Ogaz ""There's a greater fight in a dog working in the sense of a "" This spring, San Bernardino County sheriff's deputies arrested seven member s of the Inland Empire The suspects were accused of an October home invasion robbery and attempted murder in Hesperia, and conspiracy to commit murder of a witness in San The group, based in San Bernardino and Hesperia, originated in Its members often have tattoos of swastikas and other symbols of hate against blacks, Hispanics and San Bernardino County Sheriff Rod Hoops said the department suspects the group is responsible for numerous murders and The Sheriff's Department also has linked the group to gun trafficking to and from Riverside While the Inland Empire Skins primarily target minorities, Ogaz said, the October home invasion and attempted murder case targeted another skinhead who was selling The organization is a traditional sect of skinheads, where members believe in remaining drug-free to keep their blood pure, and they will go after anyone known to be using or selling drugs, Ogaz The same day the suspects were arrested, April 20, two women in the gang ha d arranged to give birth because it would have been Adolf Hitler's 120th birthday, Ogaz MOTIVATIONS FOR HATE While black people remain the most frequent target of white supremacists, experts say hatred of Hispanic immigrants is perhaps their fastest-growing motivation, both locally and ""What we've been seeing is the growth driven by anti-immigrant propaganda,"" said Mark Potok, director of intelligence projects for the Southern Poverty Law The economic downturn also has played a role in drawing people to white supremacist groups, Mendelson Two main scapegoats are Hispanic immigrants, who are blamed for taking jobs, and Jews, blamed for the bankin g collapse, she The Riverside County district attorney's office classifies racist skinhead organizations into two categories: those traditionally focused on political ideology, and those that commit crimes more like a street ""There do seem to be more skinhead gangs with prison ties moving into the Inland Empire,"" said Nikolaus Peterson, a Riverside County deputy district ""They're not as motivated by hate as much as criminal control and dealing "" Other skinheads are opposed to racism and criminal activity, he ""You can't paint every shaved head with the same brush,"" Peterson Hollie Schrack, 24, of Big Bear City, is a member of Family Skins, which stands for Comrades Of Our Racial She said her ""racialist"" beliefs are not about hating others but about loving people of her own ""Other groups are allotted to have a significant amount of pride and venues to idealize pride for their heritage,"" she ""It's sad -- we're not allowed to be proud of being "" Schrack said she doesn't consider herself a white supremacist or superior t o other races, but she does discourage interracial Hemet police took notice of the gang last year following an August stabbing of another white supremacist who did not want to join the gang, Nishida Schrack denies race played a factor in a beating that police say members A Hispanic man was beaten into a coma in Hemet in Four members ar e charged with attacking the man while screaming ""White power,"" according to Hemet members contend they were defending themselves after the man broke into one of their On the

San Bernardino county sheriff's departments have gan g task forces that track the white supremacists in addition to other street The Hemet Valley Gang Task Force has joined with the Riverside County Sheriff's Department and district attorney's office to add white supremacis t groups to their gang-prevention Gang officers are attempting to reach teens and their families to steer them away from

leaders and violent members, authorities say, little can be done to stop hate groups from forming, or to change their If one group is dismantled, oftentimes more quickly Still, Inland law enforcement agents say they are trying to stop the groups from gaining momentum by enforcement against smaller The intention is that tracking groups and making arrests will prevent larger conspiracies from being

"Dear Tom, Thanks for forwarding the message from John Excuse me for being so blunt, but John's message is just a load of utter I got a laugh out of John's claim that Santer et (2008) was ""poorly done"". This was kind of ironic coming from a co-author of the Douglass et (2007) paper, which used a fundamentally flawed statistical test to compare modeled and observed tropospheric temperature To my knowledge, John has NEVER acknowledged that Douglass et used a flawed statistical test to reach incorrect conclusions - despite unequivocal evidence from the ""synthetic data"" experiments in Santer et (2008) that the Douglass et ""robust consistency"" test was simply Unbelievably, Christy continues to assert that the results of Douglass et (2007) ""still stand"". I can only shake my head in amazement at such intellectual I guess the best form of defense is a ""robust"" So how does John support his contention that Santer et (2008) was ""poorly done""? He begins by stating that: ""Santer et 2008 used ERSST data which I understand has now been changed in a way that discredits the conclusion there"". Maybe you or Tom Peterson or Dick Reynolds can enlighten me on this How exactly have NOAA ERSST surface data changed? Recall that Santer et (2008) actually used two different versions of the ERSST data (version 2 and version 3). We also used HadISST sea-surface temperature data, and combined SSTs and land 2m temperature data from In other words, we used four different observational estimates of surface temperature Our bottom-line conclusion (no significant discrepancy between modeled and observed lower-tropospheric lapse-rate trends) was not sensitive to our choice of observed surface temperature John next assets that: ""Haimberger's (of the radiosonde data) are clearly spurious due to the error in ECMWF as published many places"". I'll let Leo Haimberger respond to that And if of Leo's data is ""clearly spurious"", why did John Christy agree to be a co-author on the Douglass et paper which uses upper-air data from Santer et (2008) comprehensively examined structural uncertainties in the observed upper-air They looked at two different satellite and seven different radiosonde-based estimates of tropospheric temperature As in the case of the surface temperature data, getting the statistical test right was much more important (in terms of the bottom-line conclusions) than the choice of observational upper-air Christy's next criticism of our IJoC paper is even more He states that: ""Santer et 2008 asked a very different we Our question was ""Does the IPCC BEST ESTIMATE agree with the Best Data (including RSS)?"" Answer - Santer et asked, ""Does ANY IPCC model agree with ANY data set?"" I think you can see the Actually, we asked and answered BOTH of these ""Tests with individual model realizations"" are described in Section of Santer et (2008), while Section covers ""Tests with multi-model ensemble-mean trend"". As should be obvious - even to John Christy - we did NOT just compare observations with results from individual For both types of test (""individual model"" and ""multi-model average""), we found that, if one applied appropriate statistical tests (which Douglass et failed to do), there was no longer a serious discrepancy between modeled and observed trends in tropical lapse rates or in tropical tropospheric Again, I find myself shaking my head in How can John make such patently false claims about our paper? The kindest interpretation is that he is a complete idiot, and has not even bothered to read Santer et (2008) before making erroneous criticisms of The less kind interpretation is that he is deliberately A good scientist is willing to acknowledge the errors he or she commits (such as applying an inappropriate statistical test). John Christy is not a good I'm not a religious man, but I'm sure willing to thank some higher authority that John Christy is not the ""gatekeeper"" of what constitutes sound I hope you don't mind, Tom, but I'm copying this email to some of the other co-authors of the Santer et (2008) IJoC They deserve to know about the kind of disinformation Christy is With best regards, Ben",0

"Susan et , I had also seen the Forster et al paper and was glad to see he had followed up on work and ideas we had discussed some years ago when he was at Reading and from the Exeter At the time I had done some simple research on whether the stratosphere could affect the tropical troposphere - possibly through convection modification or radiative I'd done a simple timeseries regression of T2LT a Tsurf+b T4+c and got some regression coefficients out that suggested an Now, this was with old and now discredited data and the Fu et technique has since superseded it to some extent (or at least cast considerable doubt upon its efficacy) it would certainly be hard to prove in a regression what was cause and effect with such broad weighting functions even using T2LT which still isn't really independent from But one thing I did do to try to ""prove"" the regression result was real is take the composite differences between QBO phases on 45 years of detrended (can't remember exactly how but I think I took differences from decadally filtered data) data from radiosondes (HadAT1 at the time). This showed a really very interesting result and suggested that this communication if it was real went quite far down in to the troposphere and was statistically significant, particularly in those seasons when the ITCZ and QBO were geographically I attach the slide for I think this is the only scientifically valid part of the analysis that I would stand by today given the rather massive developments I doubt that raobs inhomogeneities could explain the plot result as they project much more onto the trend than they would onto this type of The cooling stratosphere may really have an influence even quite low down if this QBO composite technique is a good analogue for a cooling startosphere's impact, and timeseries regression analysis supports it in some obs (it would be interesting to repeat such an analysis with the newer obs but I don't have time). A counter, however, is that surely the models do radiation so those with ozone loss should do a good job of this This could be checked in Ben's ensemble in a poor man's sense at least because some have ozone depletion and some don' The only way this could be a real factor not picked by the models, I concluded at the time, is if models are far too keen to trigger convection and that any real-world increased radiative cooling efficiency effect is masked in the models because they convect far too often and regain CAPE closure as a On another matter, we seem to be concentrating entirely on layer-average This is fine, but we know from CCSP these show little in the way of The key, and much harder test is to capture the differences in behaviour between layers / levels - the ""amplification"" This was the focus of Santer et and I still believe is the key scientific question given that each model realisation is inherently so different but that we believe the physics determining the temperature profile to be the key test that has to be Maybe we need to step back and rephrase the question in terms of the physics rather than aiming solely to rebutt Douglass et al? In this case the key physical questions in my view would be: Why is there such strong evidence from sondes for a minima at 500? Is this because it is near the triple point of water in the tropics? Or at the top of the shallow convection? Or simply an artefact? [I don't have any good ideas how we would answer the first two of these questions] Is there really a stratospheric radiative influence? If so, how low does it go? What is the cause? Are the numbers consistent with the underlying governing physics or simply an artefact of residual obs errors? Can any models show trend behaviour that deviates from a SALR on multi-decadal timescales? If so, what is it about the model that causes this effect? Physics? Forcings? Phasing of natural variability? Is it also true on shorter timescales in this model? It seems to me that trying to do an analysis based upon such physical understanding / questions will clarify things far better than simply doing another set of statistical I'm still particularly interested if #2 is really true in the raobs (its not possible to do with satellites I suspect, but if it is true it means we need to massively rethink Fu et type analysis at least in the tropics) and would be interested in helping someone follow up on that I think in the future the Forster et al paper may be seen as the more scientifically significant result when Douglass et al is no longer cared about Happy new year to you Peter",0

"Dear Friends, A few remarks before the meeting of tonight and tomorrow, I am sure that our meeting will make clearer the different objectives of ECF, in particular regarding the articulation between the scientific agenda and activities in direction to stakeholders and I would like to stress that I will attend the ECF meeting not only in the name of the Cired, but also in view of preparing the involvment of the Institut Laplace in ECF, namely the community of climate modellers, with which we develop a long term research I would like to explain hereafter in a few words what should be, in my view the priorities of ECF, in terms of scientific agenda: Given recent Ipcc experience, the first priority would be to progress in direction to integrated Indeed the lessons of the Ipcc are twofold: - first the Sress scenarios confirm the possibility of generating very different emissions growth scenarios over the long run, but the consistency between the Storylines and the numerical scenarios remain uncertain; this uncertainty and vagueness reveals a more fundamental limitation of the state of the art of economic modelling over the long run, in particular to provide an explicit picture of linkages between structural changes (infrastructure transportation, urban forms that govern the energy content of final consumption, industrial structure and the so-called dematerialisation), innovation and both macro and micro economic drivers (productivity, growth and price-signals). This makes very difficult to detect where are the real bifurcations, the real policy-parameters and to make much progress in the understanding of the timing of policy responses, - second the sections on 'damages ' have make some progress but remain weak in terms of the social and economic More precisely they deal mostly with impacts on physical parameters (sea-level rise), in a few cases adress impacts on humans (tropical diseases), but all this does not give a comprehensive picture of social and economic damages (once discounted the effect of adapatation), One of the scientific objective of ECF should be to be prepared to provide in a few years for a convincing contribution in future exercises like the SRES and in the future Ipcc This passes first through two parallel efforts: - on long term economic modelling where the limitations of existing tools are obvious depiste real progress; this relates basically to three challenges: - a macroeconomic framework insuring the consistency between prices and quantities at any point in time without necessarily resorting to the modelling tricks relying on the conventional neo-classical growth theory; these 'tricks' assume indeed perfect foresight, efficient markets and the absence of strategic or routine behaviours; New conceptual frameworks about endogenous growth theory allow for such a move, but there is a gap between advances in pure theory and empirical modelling, - the endogeneisation of technical change and more precisely to develop this endogeneisation in such a way that the information coming from sectoral models in energy, transportation or agriculture is not lost (this comes back to the bottom-up/top-down controversy); note that one key challenge here is to progress in direction to transportation and agriculture - an explicit treatment of expectations and uncertainty; one key issue indeed is that the stabilisation of expectations over the long run is the main driver of technical change, consumption patterns and structural - on 'coupling' economic and climate models: here there are two routes, either to develop coupling methods between large-scale models or to develop interface compact modules, reduced forms of large scale Both routes are valid, however, in the following years, to develop integrated models made up with reduced forms of larger models seems more promising; thanks to tractable and numerically controlable models, in will be easier to reveal the key mechanisms at work and to introduce This will pass through progress in the representation of carbon cycle (including sequestration) in such models and, more importantly in the representation of damages and adaptation, which rises rather fundamental conceptual issues that explain what seems to be the second priority in my The second prority relates to the joint question of damages and precautionary principle: - part of the agenda is covered by Mike Hulme's paper and I will not elaborate here on other dimensions I would link to include and how to assess a I will simply insist of the fact that we need to set up a taxonomy of damages in economic terms, this means as resulting not of the climate transformation per se but from the joint effect of inertia and uncertainty (to pass to Riviera to the beaches of Normandy in not a cost in itself in a world restabilized around a new climate equilibrium; what matter are the transition costs and the generated variability of climate). Moreover I would insist for adopting deliberately a worldview because, fundamentally, climate change will generate a new human geography, and not to be restricted to the European subcontinent, - this should lead to develop in parallel stochastic decision modelling tools to disentangle the many dimensions and views about the precautionary principle and, I take some risks in saying that, in a symmetric treatment of climate damages and nuclear risks (we cannot avoid to try and put some rationale in this discussion which is one of the reason for the failure of the EU tax in 1992 and of COP6, and which will be an 'hidden' division line within the EU) The third priority should be the topic 1 made by For me the two first modelling efforts I described briefly are outmostly important to bring new insights for responding the question of the However, we have, before waiting for the acheivement of a new generation of models (which will respond to point 2 and 3 of Klaus's paper), it matters to develop in parallel a specific programm on international coordination architecture given the failure of COP6 and the lack of understanding of economic and social implications of the selection of this architecture (coordination through prices or quantities, full agreement or partial expanding coalition, issue linkages, perceived equity etc ). This workprogramm should build on advances on the role of economic and non economic instruments in fostering innovation, and on the distributive static and dynamic implications of such These are very brief remarks, simply to give you some ideas about my current ",0

"Dear All, Here are a few more comments on Ideas are probably not very well First, you should try for a 3 year project and second, although here for most of the next three months (apart from odd days) I probably couldn't justify a I am intending on resubmitting another proposal to the October EU This one will involve some of the group from It's aim will be to develop a daily MSLP dataset for Europe and the Atlantic (30-70N by 70W-50E). After the dataset is produced in the first year, the second and third year will see various analyses performed and comparisons of several GCM runs performed at the Hadley This new project will probably go to which will be a different area from yours which will be Thus I would hope that your proposal could be developed over The above dataset would go back to This is the period which from the IMPROVE project is just beyond how far we think we can reliably go back with daily Several papers from the IMPROVE poject (Moberg et , 2000 in JGR and several others in press in a special issue of Climatic Change) have come to the about 1870 We have much earlier data for the 8 sites but ensuring strict homogeneity of the daily series seems doubtful for some types of extreme measures prior to about Pressure seems better than Some sites are better than Monthly is fine for All the IMPROVE and ADVICE data can be used by the ALPIPMOD I have a summer student updating the 51 monthly MSLP sites from ADVICE, amongst other As for your ideas, I think you need some overarching The atlas and CD of all the data may be one, but it also needs to address some scientific issues which can be shown to have relevance to the I like the idea of making use of the Alpine orography looking at changes in lapse rates and the use of high and low elevation air The latter is a totally independent method of looking at the warming and can be used back to the late 18th The Alps have the longest records of any mountaineous records of any region of the Also I am a strong advocate of changes in the influence of features such as the NAO (and other circulation indicators) on surface You can clearly look at these changes over the last 200 years with all the data you Another important issue to a lot of climatologists is the relative surface warming compared to the MSU2LT data in the lower Although this is hemispheric in extent, we can look with the longer Alpine records as to changes in lower level lapse rates over 200+ Related to this tropical ice caps are disappearing at alarming rates in Peru, Tanzania and in Tibet (Lonnie Thompson's work). Lonnie has calculated that the ice cap on Kilimanjaro will not be there by 2015 at its present rate of Lonnie has some local temperature series for about 40 years which show a small warming yet the ice caps are going Why? These ice caps have all been cored and have ice during the MWP times yet some aren't producing layers now ! My idea is to use the better known histories of the Alpine glaciers to see if they are also melting at accelerated rates than simple temperature averages would Keith mentioned the forward modelling approaches to determine positions in the past (and then relate these to moraine termini). Do these models still function in the last 20 years? Lonnie thinks a lot of the tropical melting is due to sublimation, which isn't accounted for by the degree day The elevational sunshine records may be important here and with temperature a particular season may be much more important than the other All the above is just ideas, but getting all the data together (instrumental and tree ring as well glacier termini and mass balance) allows us to be able to model the glaciers better than anywhere All Europeans will be interested in whether Alpine glaciers are going to disappear and there will be clear impacts on biodiversity at the high elevations and Another impact area is on the use of glacier meltwater and runoff in hydropower These are all good issues to use in the social and economic pages that need to be Cheers Phil",0

"Sulfur Emissions in New IPCC Scenarios Arnulf Gruebler, IIASA SUMMARY OF PROPOSED ACTIVITIES Review and comments of present sulfur discussion paper Revision by sulfur paper lead author Preparation of comparison of regional sulfur scenarios (by lead author with inputs from other members of writing team and experts) Timing: August Specification of minimum and desirable sulfur emission scenario characteristics and specification (for modeling teams in open process) Establishment of key relationships between sulfur emissions and other salient scenario driving force variables (income, technological change environmental, non-GHG policies) using the simple metric of sulfur to carbon emission Adoption of specific sulfur control scenarios in conformity with overall scenario ``storylines''. Distribution of ``template'' sulfur scenarios to selected modeling teams for assessment of climate and acidification impacts of sulfur Timing: End of DISCUSSION PAPER Introduction The purpose of this discussion paper is to review briefly the assumptions on sulfur emissions in the IS92 IPCC scenarios, advances in knowledge and modeling of future sulfur emission scenarios since IS92, as well as to initiate a discussion on how to incorporate future sulfur emissions trends into the new IPCC emissions The present draft will be revised based on feedback received within the members of the IPCC writing team as well as additional outside Sulfur emissions in IS92 The treatment of sulfur emissions in the IS92 scenarios was In addition to the dominant energy sector emissions, also sulfur emissions from industrial processes and land-use changes (biomass burning) and (a constant flow) of natural sources were included in the 1990 base year values in IS92 were as follows in MtS (Million tons, or Tg, elemental sulfur; to obtain weight as SO2 multiply by ): Energy Sector: 65 MtS Other Industry: 8 MtS Biomass burning: 2 MtS Natural: 22 MtS TOTAL: 98 MtS These global base year values are well within the range given by global sulfur emission inventories of 4 to 45 MtS natural sources and 65 to 90 MtS anthropogenic sources in 1990 (IPCC, 1995:135-141). A comparison of 1990 base year sulfur emission values from a number of scenarios and integrated assessment models is enclosed as However, as observed in the evaluation of the IS92 scenarios (Alcamo et , 1995) regional sulfur emissions assumed in IS92 ( for China) are much more There is for instance up to a factor two difference between regionalized estimated of global inventories and aggregates of national and regional emissions Thus, the good agreement of base year values of IS92 at the global level masks important differences and uncertainties at the regional A first important task for the new IPCC scenarios is therefore to update the regional sulfur emissions baseline values with the results of latest regional sulfur emissions Such inventories are available for Europe through EMEP and CORINAIR, North America (NAPAP), and more recently also for Asia ( the Worldbank sulfur project, Foell et , 1995). Improved modeling of regional sulfur emissions (and deposition, impacts) patterns would also require a redefinition of the world regions as used in the IS92 scenario For instance, Canada is included in the region OECD-Europe, and the IS92 region ""South Asia"" includes both the Indian subcontinent as well as Their important differences in resource endowments lead to different patterns of sulfur Their differing predominant weather patterns and distinct ecosystems lead to differing acidic deposition patterns and Both factors preclude their aggregation into one single regional Active inputs from representatives of all respective modeling communities (regional acidification impacts, regional climate modelers, energy systems analysts) will be sought on this issue and lessons learned within EMF activities ( Schlesinger) on appropriate sulfur regionalization (6 world regions) will be extremely Concerning future emissions of sulfur the IS92 scenarios project global anthropogenic emissions of between 150 to 200 MtS by 2050 and between 140 to 230 MtS by 2100 in the high growth cases, and of around 80-90 and 60 MtS in the two low scenarios (IS92c and IS92d) by 2050 and 2100 The IS92 scenario evaluation (Alcamo et , 1995:281-282) concluded that the IS92 scenario series only partially reflect recent legislation to reduce sulfur emissions ( the amendments to the Clean Air Act in the US or the Second European sulfur protocol). Hence, particularly regional sulfur emissions in OECD countries projected in IS92 are much higher than more recent scenarios taking account these legislative changes (as also discussed by IPCC, 1995:155-156). For instance the recent scenarios of the Commission of the European Communities (EC, 1996) indicate that sulfur emissions by 2020 will be between 64 to 77 percent below 1990 emissions levels, or between less than 2 to 3 MtS, compared to 8 in For comparison, the IS92 scenarios project for OECD Europe (including Canada) sulfur emissions between (IS92a and IS92b) and (all other scenarios) MtS by 2020, between 2 to 30 percent lower than in 1990 (12 MtS). In addition, integrated assessment models are increasingly able to model in greater detail driving forces of sulfur emissions as well as acidification impacts ( discussion below). These model simulations suggest that particularly in Asia acidification impacts would require substantial sulfur emission control measures already much earlier than The resulting global sulfur emissions are substantially lower than suggested in the IS92 series: typically in the range between 20 to 80 MtS by 2050 and between 20 to 120 MtS by (A comparison of global sulfur emissions scenarios with and without specific sulfur control assumptions in enclosed as ) What's New since IS92 (scientific front) The importance of aerosols including those from sulfur emissions is by now widely recognized and considerable progress has been made to quantify their effect on regional climate, both in large GCM simulations as well as in more simplified integrated assessment models, MAGICC's SCENGEN module (needs checking for details with Mike Hulme) or Michael Schlesinger's work within the EMF (current status: uncertain). The importance of sulfur emissions as input to climate models is therefore larger than As a result of a major World Bank study on acid rain in Asia also improved national and regional sulfur emissions inventories have become available (Foell et , 1995). Improved emissions inventories outside North America, Europe (including the European part of the former USSR), and Asia (excluding Oceania, for which only sparse data seems to be available) have not been made available since publication of As a result, models and scenarios continue to rely on estimates, largely based on approximate mass and sulfur balance approaches in the world regions for the Middle East, Southern Africa, and Latin America ( discussion of data availability below). Similarly, acidification impact models are increasingly being refined for regions outside OECD in particular for Acidification impact studies for unabated sulfur emissions of coal intensive ``business as usual'' scenarios indicate exceedance of critical loads of up to a factor 10 already within the next three to four decades (Amann et , 1995) with enormous impacts on natural ecosystems as well as important foodcrops (Fischer et , 1996). Increasingly also energy sector and integrated assessment models link regional acidification models with simplified climate models enabling joint analysis of sulfur and climate policies and Examples include the IMAGE model (Posch et , 1996) and the IIASA integrated assessment model (Rogner and Nakicenovic, 1996) that are linked with the acidification model RAINS for Europe and Asia, the AIM (Morita et , 1994) model for Asia, or ???? for North These models extend earlier energy sector models that dealt with a comparative costs assessment of isolated sulfur and carbon reductions, and joint mitigation respectively, such as the OECD GREEN model (Complainville and Martins, 1994). The state of knowledge of joint benefits of sulfur and carbon emission reductions was reviewed in the 1995 IPCC WG III report (IPCC, 1996: 215-218) and is expanding Data requirements The most obvious data requirements concern of course comprehensiveness of sulfur emissions by major source category (anthropogenic and natural, energy sector and other industrial sources). Here the data model of the IS92 scenarios appears appropriate and would only require a reassessment in view of most recent data concerning regional emissions (particularly in China, where data uncertainties seem largest). A more difficult question concerns spatial Independent from the question of which formal models are being used to check for scenario consistency, the outmost spatial detail currently in driving force models with global coverage available is at the level of world regions (typically around 10, but going up to around 20 world regions). Both climate as well as acidification models require inputs at finer spatial It is unclear at present what would constitute a ``minimum'' or ``desirable'' level of spatial disaggregation for the variety of user communities of new IPCC Existing model links (like with the RAINS model) could be used in some regions like Europe and Asia to generate spatially highly disaggregated sulfur emission and deposition maps as inputs for climate models and for impact assessment studies ( for agricultural crop yield models). In their most advanced versions the model links even incorporate regionalized differential growth trends and thus improve on the standard practice of renormalizing base year spatial emission and deposition patterns linearly with a particular sulfur emissions For regions where similar links are unavailable, more simplified procedures will need to be devised, keeping in mind the overall tight time frame of the scenario Two data sets (are there more??) appear available for regionalized sulfur emission patterns: the Oak Ridge GAIA data set (spatial resolution: ????) and the Spiro et (1992) data set (spatial resolution: one degree by one degree). An open (but extremely critical) issue remaining to be resolved is to identify mechanisms and responsible groups that could provide the link between the spatial resolution of the new IPCC scenarios sulfur emissions to whatever final geographical scales required by impact assessment and climate Scenarios and Sulfur Policies There are two major sets of driving force variable that influence future sulfur Level and structure of energy supply and end use, and degree of sulfur control policies (Because of the dominance of energy related sulfur emissions, they should receive particular attention in the new Industrial sources could be included in the scenarios with much a simpler driving force model, coupling to industrial ) Ceteris paribus, highest sulfur emissions occur in scenarios of high demand growth, rapid resource depletion, limited technological change and absence of sulfur control policies outside OECD In terms of energy supply structures such scenarios imply a massive use of coal, including synfuel Typical examples would include the IS92e and IS92f Up to 2050 sulfur emissions in such scenarios roughly grow in line with fossil fuel use and resulting carbon emissions, a roughly constant sulfur to carbon emissions Post 2050, still in absence of sulfur control policies, growth rates of sulfur emissions start to fall short of growth in fossil fuel use due to the internal technology logic of synfuel production: synfuel production requires prior coal conversion ( gasification) and removal of sulfur prior to further conversion, to Ceteris paribus, therefore sulfur emissions relative to those of carbon Sulfur emissions are lower in scenarios with lower demand, more ample resource availability (especially for natural gas), higher rates of technological change (especially for non-fossil energy technologies), and extent and timing of direct sulfur control policies especially outside OECD countries (itself function of projected impacts like acidification), and finally, level of other environmental control measures and valuation of environmental goods ( sulfur emissions are also lower in scenarios imposing limits on GHG emissions). Next to environmental impacts and policies, there are also other key relationships that need to be considered for the formulation of future sulfur For instance, the literature on environmental Kuznets curves ( World Bank, 1992, or IIASA-WEC, 1995) argues that with increasing affluence and valuation of environmental goods, sulfur emissions This hypothesis is corroborated by both longitudinal and cross-sectional empirical Thus, in the process of industrialization and economic development, emissions rise initially, pass through a maximum (say at income levels around 2000 $/capita) and decline thereafter with rising per capita incomes and the resulting preference of cleaner end-use fuels, valuation of clean environments, A scenario taxonomy along the dimensions of demand, resource availability, and technological change in any case is necessary to respond to the critique on the IS92 series that these important driving forces were not varied appropriately to reflect both uncertainty as well as new scientific knowledge and empirical They form part of the overall scenario design process and the scenario ``storylines'' and need not to be addressed specifically in the work on sulfur Separate ``sulfur stories'' could be developed in addition, based on various relationships between sulfur emissions and levels of affluence, industrial structure, within the overall framework of the scenario ``storylines''. Here sulfur emissions would be part of other environmental policies ( on water quality, urban traffic related pollutants, ) that form integral part of particular scenario ``storylines''. A key variable remains the timing and extent of sulfur control policies to be assumed for the new First of all the scenarios need to reflect changes in actual policies As noted above, IS92 did not take full account of recent environmental legislation in both North America and the second European sulfur Secondly, the sulfur policies to be assumed, need to reflect recent scientific findings, in particular the very large local and regional impacts on agricultural crops and ecosystems of unabated high sulfur emission scenarios, particularly in Therefore, all scenarios should assume faster and deeper reductions in sulfur emissions outside OECD countries than were assumed for IS92 in light of this recent scientific The exact timing and extent of such sulfur reduction measures could then be scenario Also no specific reference to individual policy measures would need to be made (to avoid normative policy elements, or recommendations, in the scenarios), as reduction profiles could be adopted from existing sulfur reduction scenarios in the scientific literaursement by UE (Action COST) for the lecturer, but for this I hope to",0

They are not the neat, tidy beasts Keenan would like them to This holds not only for surface temperature It also holds - in spades - for measurements of tropospheric temperature from MSU and radiosondes, and for measurements of ocean temperatures from XBTs, profiling floats, We would like observing systems to be more accurate, more stable, and better-suited for monitoring decadal-scale changes in You and Kevin and many other are actively working towards that The key message here is that, despite uncertainties in the surface temperature record - uncertainties which you and others in the field are well aware of, and have worked hard to quantify - it is now unequivocal that surface temperatures have warmed markedly over the past 100 Uncertainties in the station histories do not negate this basic Hope some of these random musings might be useful, Let me know if there's anything else I can do to Will you be at the Hadley Centre Science Review Group meeting in May?

"Hi David, thanks for the I think your arguments to add some comments of explanation re Pliocene warmth are convincing and that there is potential relevance for IPCC concerning heat transport in a world with less land and sea My concern is that I don't think the text should be interpreted to imply that the Mid Pliocene was free of Arctic sea ice and Greenland was ice There is evidence from the recent IODP Central Arctic Drilling (have to check what to use) of sea ice cover through the I have publishet on IRD evidence for a Greenland ice sheet of some Concerning THC, N Atlantic data indicate strong presence of NADW akin to now, but we cannot constrain overturning Both Nordic Seas an Arctic Ocean was poorly ventilated and deep water formation to feed overflows was shallover, perhaps due to higher temperature? Instead of deleting the section I proposed, I suggest changing it as follows: After (Rind and Chadler 1991) add , ""for which available proxy data are inconclusive"", and Instead of writing ""absence of land ice"", write "" reduced extent of land and sea ice"". I will find the best refs for this on Cheers Eystein",0

No need to take this to a higher level? Keith Briffa is back on line and finishing off Section , so you might want to send him an email w/ suggestions that help keep chap 6 compatible w/ 2 and 9 - for example, with respect to solar, we acknowledge the forcing could be less than W/m 2, and the uncertaintly wrt to trop aerosols and land albedo is significant - we could easily be closer to chap 9's Would you say the key is that our analysis acknowledge the uncertainty so as to overlap well with the other chapters? Keith - please make sure you send your new to David too - while you were out, he was working hard w/ chap 2 and 9 to make sure we (the IPCC) avoid saying things that The comparison of radiative forcings from 3 different angles is what assessment is all about, and it's great David has had the patience to help figure it all Thx, Peck Hi Gabi, The key to your proposed solution is the updated numbers from Chapter If indeed the radiative forcing change to 1750 is , then presumably you have made this consistent with the earlier part of Chapter The numbers previously looked like this (I haven't seen the latest version of , but I've included the previous estimates we had in the ZOD): W/m 2 Chapter 6 Chapter 9 MM 1750 Greenhouse gases: TROP aerosols: Solar Volcanic: ? ? Land albedo: + Trop O3: Strat O3: + 1'st indirect aerosol forcing STRAT H2O AVIATION TOTAL There is essentially no change in greenhouse gas forcing from 1750 to 1700 (see for example Crowley et , GRL, 2003), so the difference in the estimated numbers is probably due to inclusion of more things or different choices in Chapter A similar statement holds for trop One can also use these two to presume that the same also holds true for land [The value listed for that in Chapter 9 is quite small compared to some other studies; , Govindasamy et , GRL, 28, 291-294, ] So, to the extent these numbers are still discussed in Chapter 6, they should be made consistent with those in chapters 2 and With respect to your proposed paragraph below: I would drop the comments about trace gas differences but saying land albedo changes may have been greater, along with the additional solar change, could give us the W/m 2 Concerning the temperature response: the Moberg et al paper itself claims 1C difference between 1500 and 2000, but the figure seems to show a larger number, perhaps (again, just eye-balling it). However, the coldest time period is not in the MM but before I think therefore a better estimate from that paper for the MM would be So, with respect to the sensitivity: if W/m 2 is unresolved, then we have a total forcing of ~ W/m 2, and a climate response varying between and 1C - or a climate sensitivity for 2xCO2 of to , or pretty similar to standard IPCC I think this will work!

"Trump aides' rivalries plague super PACs By Kenneth Vogel and Ben Schreckinger 05/18/2016 05:16 AM EDT The power struggle inside Donald Trump's presidential campaign is spilling over into the world of his super PAC allies, freezing wealthy supporters who want to write big checks to boost the presumptive GOP nominee over likely Democratic opponent Hillary Top Trump adviser Paul Manafort has privately expressed support for a yet-to-be-launched super PAC that would be affiliated with a close friend of the Multiple sources familiar with the matter said Manafort's allies hope the PAC will become the favored vehicle for huge checks from mega-donors like Las Vegas casino mogul Sheldon Adelson, who is believed to be considering spending as much as $100 million boosting But the sources said that Manafort's chief internal rival, Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, who is close to Adelson's advisers, is not on board with the plan for the new And they suggest that if Lewandowski doesn't like the set-up, he may signal his support for a totally different outside spending vehicle - possibly one that hasn't even been created An adviser to Adelson, whose donations are being closely watched as a bellwether to other donors, told POLITICO ""we are not anywhere near a decision on who will receive money or how much we will "" Adelson will make his own decision independent of Trump campaign aides' signals, the adviser Neither Manafort, Lewandowski, nor the Trump campaign responded to requests for comment about the lack of clear signals from the campaign about a preferred super Trump allies fear that continued confusion could cripple their slow-starting big-money fundraising effort, which has been plagued by It's an especially acute problem for Trump, since he eschewed fundraising and openly antagonized the GOP donor class during his mostly self-funded primary campaign, allowing Clinton and her allies to build a massive cash advantage using a quartet of super PACs working closely together to fill well-defined The four main super PACs devoted to Clinton have combined to raise $89 million from the beginning of last year through the end of March, the period covered by the most recent FEC And the leading pro-Clinton super PAC, Priorities USA Action, has already reserved $90 million in television ad time in key swing states for tough general election ads against By contrast, more than two dozen mostly unauthorized outside groups that claim to support Trump have raised a total of $ million this cycle, but only six of the groups have actually bought ads supporting And because Trump had disavowed all super PACs until recently, his advisers haven't given donors much indication about which, if any, outside groups they One of the few pro-Trump super PACs to gain any momentum, Great America PAC, was seen within GOP finance circles as having a tacit blessing from While the group had struggled to raise cash and was $690,000 in the red at the end of March, it had begun establishing itself in recent weeks as the leading vehicle in a growing field of pro-Trump super PACs that features many entrants using the candidate's name to raise money while spending little in support of his Former Texas Rick Perry is scheduled to participate in a donor conference call for Great America PAC on Wednesday, according to an invitation obtained by POLITICO, and the group announced a donor retreat at the ranch of billionaire Texas energy investor Boone But as Great America PAC has gained credibility and started winning support from key donors, Manafort's allies have stepped up their attacks on it as a scam, and some have expressed support for competing groups, including one launched last week called the Committee to Restore American The PACs that legitimately want to help Trump need to figure out a way to work together, or they will end up squandering cash on competing efforts, warned the influential GOP mega-donor Stanley The Minnesota broadcasting billionaire this month joined the advisory committee of Great America PAC, and on Tuesday he told POLITICO that he had written a six-figure check to the He added that he was open to giving more, but said he would not give to other pro-Trump super ""If they call me, they're wasting their time, because one is Too many cooks in the kitchen ruin the stew,"" he said, suggesting that the super PAC competition is less about tactics and more about ""What you have to do is keep ego out of I think ego creeps into too many "" Any attempts to create clarity in the super PAC derby - and to shut down scammers who are raising money off of Trump - are complicated by federal election rules barring super PACs and other big-money groups from coordinating with candidates and their campaigns or party A Trump campaign official said uncertainty about the universe of pro-Trump PACs and the ""dark figures involved"" is deterring major donors who previously supported Trump's vanquished GOP presidential rivals including Chris Christie, Jeb Bush and John ""They're all waiting for the right vehicle,"" said the ""The fact of the matter is that we just have a Nobody's eager to throw their money down a rat "" The official suggested that this problem could be solved by the entrance of a super PAC blessed by Manafort and affiliated with California real estate billionaire named Thomas A close ally of Trump's, Barrack has had discussions with Manafort and others about becoming involved in a new super PAC, according to sources in and around the Barrack, who has praised the presumptive GOP nominee's ""charm and emotional intelligence"" and is set to host a fundraiser for Trump this month in Los Angeles, was traveling internationally Tuesday and could not be reached for The Trump campaign official added: ""Tom Barrack is one of Trump's friends and there's a lot of concerns about fingers that are in these pies . . . Nobody trusts anybody in these non-affiliated groups and Trump trusts Barrack "" But even if Barrack - who has not previously been a major donor, scattering $67,000 among Democratic and Republican campaigns over the years - puts his full weight into an outside spending effort that has Manafort's blessing, some Trump allies fear that may not quash the rivalries between the super PACs, which reflect deep personal Beyond the Manafort-Leandowski rift, Manafort and his allies have a tricky decades-long history with the leaders of Great America PAC and the Committee to Restore American During Ronald Reagan's 1984 reelection campaign, Manafort and his close ally Roger Stone worked together, sometimes uneasily, with Ed Rollins, the co-chairman of Great America PAC, and Doug Watts, the national executive director of the Committee to Restore American Stone's ex-wife Ann Stone also has discussed launching a super PAC that will work to win over women to vote for Trump, a source familiar with the effort told The source said Stone is working with Amy Kremer, who formerly was associated with Great America, and Kathryn Serkes, and that they have suggested their effort has an unofficial blessing from Trump's Ann Stone, Kremer and Serkes did not respond to requests for comment, nor did a Trump campaign After Watts announced the creation of his super PAC, Rollins pushed back, releasing a statement this week predicting that his Great America PAC will be ""the best-funded, most effective independent committee supporting Trump's "" Roger Stone lashed back, calling Great America a ""scam PAC,"" and pointing out that one of its advisers was convicted of a campaign finance violation this month, while Rollins had worked as an adviser to a firm started by a former Bill Clinton But Eric Beach, Great America's co-chairman, pointed to Trump's praise of Rollins as ""tremendous"" earlier this month as a sign that the businessman views the group favorably, while the mega-donor Hubbard said having Rollins on board is a selling ""He's certainly had a lot of "" A Rollins ally suggested that Stone helped create the Committee to Restore American Sovereignty as a way to undermine Great America And Rollins himself suggested that Stone is obsessed with him, asserting ""I don't spend my life tracking Roger He may spend his life tracking me but I don't spend my life tracking "" Stone did not directly respond to questions about his role in the Committee to Restore American Sovereignty, but he did say he planned to contribute $1,000 to the group, and he questioned the depth of Rollins' commitment to Rollins will ""end up attacking Trump,"" Stone Watts laughed off the suggestion that Stone had put him up to creating the PAC as a means of undermining ""Ed and I are friends of 40 years and were business partners for a few year so I wouldn't do something that was predicated on that basis,"" Watts ""Both Ed and Roger have had an obsession with one another over the I'm not sure what the genesis is but it has a life of its "" Watts countered that his PAC's fundraising approach was superior to Great America' ""They're already in debt and I have no idea what their designs are,"" he But he also said there was room for multiple pro-Trump outside groups and that Barrack's group could be a positive addition to the crowded ""Three to five super PACs in support of the same candidacy is not a bad It means you have a wider net that you're casting for contributions,"" Watts ""So I welcome it, "" Alex Isenstadt contributed to this To view online: To change your alert settings, please go to or email was sent to user@domain by: POLITICO, LLC 1000 Wilson Arlington, VA, 22209, USA To unsubscribe,",0

"Valerie, Francoise et We also were suprised by the ""conclusion"" that there was a 9-7 ka This probably arose from a statement by Greg Zielinski regarding the Arctic In any case, the article by Dominique and Kieth was just a rough draft -- we have pointed out the mistake to them and I expect we will all see a final version anyway! Regarding the subject of the HIHOL paper, we agree that there are already many papers published that dicuss the temperature interpretation of isotopic records during the What has not been done, however, is to include the best Holocene records from both polar regions in a single paper, nor to make a specific comparison of the timing and magnitude of the optimum (or optima). For example, the elevation effect on the long-term trends for East Antartica has been discussed (Masson et , 2000) but not Of course quantifying this effect is difficult but our paper could put useful error estimates, for example, on the amount of cooling in the late We do not of course wish to compete with Sigfus, but his paper will be more limited in geographic focus than ours and will include new data that we will not It would be good to include NGRIP borehole temperatures if we can, but this is not Even the GRIP and GISP2 records show very clearly the Holocene Our suggestion would be to let Dorethe decide on that, in consultation with In our vision, one of the key features of the Holocene article will be its deliberately limited scope and confinement to observation rather than speculation about causes of climate We think that to involve modelers and oceanographers makes it difficult to keep the focus and is rather beyond the intended purposes of the Holocene Keep in mind that modelling was looked at separately at the HIHOL meeting and we believe that the modelers at the meeting are planning their own contribution to the As mentioned earlier, we think the best way to get the paper going is to begin soon the process of simply collating data sets and putting them all on one We can then discuss the details of the paper with the same image in front of each of We hope that you can agree more-or-less with the above, and that others on our email list will also provide some We are of course open to further discussion!

"Dear Ben, many thanks for the full response to my I think my confusion arose from the discussion on RealClimate (which prompted our earlier communication on this topic), which clearly suggested that the observed trend should be expected to lie within the spread of the models, rather than neccessarily being close to the mean as the models are stochastic simulations (which seemed reasonable). I've just re-read that post, the key paragraph from [1] is as follows: ""The interpretation of this is a little unclear (what exactly does the sigma refer to?), but the most likely interpretation, and the one borne out by looking at their Table IIa, is that sigma is calculated as the standard deviation of the model In that case, the formula given defines the uncertainty on the estimate of the mean - how well we know what the average trend really But it only takes a moment to realise why that is Imagine there were 1000's of simulations drawn from the same distribution, then our estimate of the mean trend would get sharper and sharper as N However, the chances that any one realisation would be within those error bars, would become smaller and Instead, the key standard deviation is simply sigma That defines the likelihood that one realisation ( the real world) is conceivably drawn from the distribution defined by the "" I had therefore expected the test to use the standard deviations of both the models and the observations (which would give a flat plot in 5B and there would be an obvious overlap of the uncertainties in 6a at say 500hPa). best regards Gavin -----Original Message----- From: Ben Santer [[2]mailto:user@domain] Sent: Fri 10/31/2008 4:06 AM To: Cawley Gavin Dr (CMP) Cc: Jones Philip Prof (ENV); Gavin Schmidt; Thorne, Peter; Tom Wigley Subject: Re: Possible error in recent IJC paper Dear Gavin, Thanks very much for your email, and for your interest in our recent paper in the International Journal of Climatology (IJoC). There is no error in equation (12) in our IJoC Let me try to answer the questions that you The first term under the square root in our equation (12) is a standard estimate of the variance of a sample mean - see, , ""Statistical Analysis in Climate Research"", by Francis Zwiers and Hans von Storch, Cambridge organization Press, 1999 (their equation , page 86). The second term under the square root sign is a very different beast - an estimate of the variance of the observed As we point out, our d1 test is very similar to a standard Student's t-test of differences in means (which involves, in its denominator, the square root of two pooled sample variances). In testing the statistical significance of differences between the model average trend and a single observed trend, Douglass et were wrong to use sigma_SE as the sole measure of trend uncertainty in their statistical Their test assumes that the model trend is uncertain, but that the observed trend is The observed trend is not a ""mean"" quantity; it is NOT Douglass et made a demonstrably false Bottom line: sigma_SE is a standard estimate of the uncertainty in a sample mean - which is why we use it to characterize uncertainty in the estimate of the model average trend in equation (12). It is NOT appropriate to use sigma_SE as the basis for a statistical test between two uncertain The uncertainty in the estimates of both modeled AND observed trend needs to be explicitly incorporated in the design of any statistical test seeking to compare modeled and observed Douglass et incorrectly ignored uncertainties in observed I hope this answers your first question, and explains why there is no inconsistency between the formulation of our d1 test in equation (12) and the comments that we made in point #3 [immediately before equation (12)]. As we note in point #3, ""While sigma_SE is an appropriate measure of how well the multi-model mean trend can be estimated from a finite sample of model results, it is not an appropriate measure for deciding whether this trend is consistent with a single observed "" We could perhaps have made point #3 a little clearer by inserting ""imperfectly-known"" before ""observed trend"". I thought, however, that the uncertainty in the estimate of the observed trend was already made very clear in our point #1 (on page 7, bottom of column 2). To answer your second question, d1 gives a reasonably flat line in Figure 5B because the first term under the square root sign in equation (12) (the variance of the model average trend, which has a dependence on N, the number of models used in the test) is roughly a factor of 20 smaller than the second term under the square root sign (the variance of the observed trend, which has no dependence on N). The behaviour of d1 with synthetic data is therefore dominated by the second term under the square root sign - which is why the black lines in Figure 5B are In answer to your third question, our Figure 6A provides only one of the components from the denominator of our d1 test (sigma_SE). Figure 6A does not show the standard errors in the observed trends at discrete pressure Had we attempted to show the observed standard errors at individual pressure levels, we would have produced a very messy Figure, since Figure 6A shows results from 7 different observational We could of course have performed our d1 test at each discrete pressure This would have added another bulky Table to an already lengthy We judged that it was sufficient to perform our d1 test with the synthetic MSU T2 and T2LT temperature trends calculated from the seven radiosonde datasets and the climate model The results of such tests are reported in the final paragraph of Section As we point out, the d1 test ""indicates that the model-average signal trend (for T2LT) is not significantly different (at the 5% level) from the observed signal trends in three of the more recent radiosonde products (RICH, IUK, and RAOBCORE )."" So there is no inconsistency between the formulation of our d1 test in equation (12) and the results displayed in Figure Thanks again for your interest in our paper, and my apologies for the delay in replying to your email - I have been on travel (and out of email contact) for the past 10 With best regards, Ben",0

"Dear Keith, Bette and Eystein: This email should be read after the one to the entire team - it provides post LA3/TS feedback on Since Bette is going on a short vacation, she and I emailed about her new LIG fig before I left, so she's ready to go when she gets Keith (and Tim), on the other hand, have lots to consider, and I just wanted to reiterate to you (and Bette) that it's a priority for me and Eystein to help you brainstorm all these Here are a few more comments I got on Keith/Tim Figs: For 1) removing the oldest portion of the records from the plot is only ok IF: -we can justify on an obvious and objective basis - for example that sample depth hits goes down significantly at 700AD or wherever we want to chop -We don't remove part of the series that will give rise to accusations of bias Thus, it might be better to leave as was in the FOD, just to be safe, or to try multiple 2) had a long talk with Martin Manning about the idea of multiple plots, vs just the existing one (by the way, the TS team WANTS the instrumental part of the fig as we agreed to modify in Chap 6 sessions). I think the best idea is to keep the bottom panel as is, with modifications - keep the error bars as is - try a version with some sort of annually-resolved volc forcing placed at the top of the panel, with eruption (sufate) lines sticking down farther for big eruptions - try inserting some representation of average (median? or?) sample depth along the bottom (time) side of the This will thus show, lots of sample depth back to 1700, then less and less (in steps?). Martin suggests we go one step farther and color the sample depth part of the plot with different colors, based on our expert judgement of We could have two or three colors - one color for the interval overwhich we have ""very likely"" confidence ( , in the exec summary) and another for just "" "" perhaps we want a third for some term reflecting ""don't trust inferences regarding hemispheric temp that much over this interval"" - this will obviously take some thinking/creativity, but this fig will go all the way to the TSM, so it's worth the 3) linear axis for sure 4) if would still be good to try a density shaded version of this plot (instead of all the recon lines) for the TS and When in doubt, make an extra We can then share with our team and with Thanks for doing this! Also, FYI, Gabe indicated that her regional plots were not scaled Surprising, but maybe the models are actually better than we Best, Peck",0
"Keith, Attached is the Stendel et al paper (submitted to ""Climate Dynamics"" last month) and a corrected version of their Figure 3 (using the correct Mann and Jones NH series).

We just want to make sure his character and his interactions and relationships with the other monsters are everything they can Let's make him into a greater presence in the film and give him some more attitude and Because you just turned the draft around, we want to offer some specific ideas and suggestions of things for existing On a similar front, the idea of this human kid in a monster hotel is a big one, so wed love to find a few moments in Act 1 when we the contrast of a human baby/kid against the dangerous monstery-ness of the Like getting caught in one of the spa contraptions, or in the spinning class web or Mavis asking for organic food for Dennis and getting the monster version of Quick bits that maybe could be juxtaposed with the baby-proofing or Moments like these would help in the marketing of the Specific areas: In general, Denniss use of cebause instead of because makes him sound very Lets consider having him say because anywhere theres a cebause to make him sound Page 23: Making Dennis more self-aware would help to age up his personality and maybe he recognizes in this scene that his attempts to fly arent Page 23: To not make Dennis seem so baby-ish, maybe he doesnt cry in this It could be enough that his lip quivers like hes about to cry, and this is enough to make Drac try anything so that he wont 24-25: Dennis reads very young when he shouts out Video! and Yay! Video! Without those lines, he might read 27: When Wanda sprays Winnie to get her off of Dennis, maybe Dennis plays it more cool, like Its okay, Aunt Wanda, I can handle 26-30: In general during Wolfpup Party, it would help if Dennis had more of an attitude that he can hang with the (We love when he says, ) For example, when Mavis tells him to be careful, Dennis would seem older if he told his mom to stop because shes embarrassing him; he doesnt want to be treated like a ",0

"Phil, I think you need to respond by providing E&E with a simple answer of ""false"" to Keenan's write-up, based on the communication with me (but no mention of SUNYA confidentiality issue, it has to come directly from SUNYA). That will force E E to contact either me directly or If the former, I can refer to SUNYA also, and let the organization to handle My reading is that, since the IPCC policy report is coming out soon (in October?), Keenan is in panic and wants to tint the Nature paper as much and as soon as possible, so he can not wait for SUNYA to conduct ""inquery"" (not investigation) which he knows he is not getting what he Going to news medium will not do his trick because he can not really explain So in a way Keenan traps himself now, betting on that the ""station history"" was not available and that the stations have moved a lot (he does not know that at all). We are facing a tricky person and group, and the only way to do it is to follow the procedure to drive them E&E is not going to publish it without giving me the chance to respond, and that is when SUNYA comes in and that is what Keenan does not want to see as well, he wants to create a smocky screen before the truth comes We are not going to let Keenan doing things his So be easy, and respond directly what you learn from me (and any other scienctific issues you can identify) and perhaps even ask E&E to contact me/or SUNYA for I know you are under tremendous pressure, but Keenan is in panic and what he has done is going back to burn him, We should be thinking, after the whole odeal is over, to take legal (or other) actions against This is time I regre not been a rich person, otherwise I can throw a million dollar lawsuit against Let me know what you want to I have also asked SUNYA's opinion about what you should do within the SUNYA But be careful that you do not know much about SUNYA WCW",0

"Hi Jeffrey,Thank you for At first read some really great info and learnings for For now, a couple things that stand I think the slide titled Dispicable Me 2 Performance suggests Bigger HT2 Opportunities is too aggressive of a comp to The next line after that title suggests that Hotel T2 should grow like DM2 because HT1 was bigger than DM1; However, Rio 2 was bigger than DM1 and Rio 2 didnt have anywhere near the growth Rio 1 that DM2 had I just dont think the numbers support the conclusion that a bigger box office of the original in theatrical necessarily correlates to growth rate for sequels for animated I agree with you that the ancillary business will probably confirm that the Minions drove that film to new levels after the theatrical I absolutely want to chase the success of DM2 but I think we should go easier on this The other thing that stands out is the idea that Latin America projects to more growth than other While it is most definitely an opportunity region on this franchise, as we are releasing in a non-holiday time frame, the market size for family films can have a I am very bullish on the region but we have to keep in mind that Hotel T is already up there among the very biggest non-holiday family releases of Im optimistic, but we have to explore how we can eventize it to get a broader opening weekend audience as family will only take us so , some really great stuff I think you have the hooks nailed (Fish out of Water, Mavis/Drac relationship, cute monsters, ).

"I think that this story could possible catch on and make headlines, so I agree that we should be But it's important that we bring the true picture out, and it is best that this is done by RealClimate rather than a sceptic The general scientific side of the IPCC report ( all the peer-reviewed papers ad the scientific theories) is still sound, but to explain how one figure was shoe-horned into the report is harder to The sceptics may argue that the IPCC reports are political after all, and this is also what it sounds like if governments 'hoisted the national flag' by having it's own figures inserted last However, by providing an account of the 'evolution of the IPCC report writing', we could possibly give the story a softer how many times of review the first report underwent as compared to the present We should also put this in perspective - the report is large and covers a wide range of topics, and most (all but our case?) is true to the There are sometimes a few rotten apples in a good batch, But the important part is that we don't accept rotten apples and that we sort it out!

"Dear Mike, I've not yet looked at your Tyndall biography, but I see your logic in suggesting his His 1861 papers in 4, 22, 169-194 and 273-285 were arguable the first reasonable descriptions of the CO2 (or, in his words, ""carbonic acid"") greenhouse However, it is generally believed that Fourier, in 1827, was the first person to allude to a greenhouse effect and to suggest that human activities might affect the climate (see, , Ramanathan, Science 240, 293-299, 1988). In my view, however, neither Tyndall nor Fourier would be appropriate for naming a climate centre devoted to human-induced Tyndall is not appropriate because he did not consider (or even dream of) the human influence; while Fourier is not appropriate because it would not be to name a UK centre after a Furthermore, both Tyndall and Fourier are well-known and well-recognized for their contributions in other The person who really deserves the credit is Callendar who, in 1938, not only suggested that human influences were causing CO2 to increase, but also that this was causing global Furthermore, he did an amazing job documenting both the CO2 build up and the Essentially, it was Callendar who, more than 60 years ago, really exposed the problem that is our current His work was a quantum leap above anything done previously; and, one could argue, was not really improved upon until Manabe and Wetherald's seminal 1967 (JAS 24, 241-259) I doubt whether there is an intellectual milestone in any field that compares with Best wishes, Tom",0

"Dear Shaopeng and Henry, First, congratulations on the Nature Can you send me some reprints when you get them ? I was at a meeting this week with Tom Crowley and we were discussing ways to reconcile the high-freq proxies with your borehole Here are a couple of our Involving Mike Mann and others here in CRU, as they all have an I've shown that the borehole data in Europe agree well with the long instrumental data in both the UK and The biggest differences/problems seem to come with the North American borehole data, which show the 16/17/18th data much cooler than the European/Asian/African data in the 16/17th I'm still reminded by the potential effects of land-use changes, principally in the eastern US, which could be making your North American series too I realise you've taken great care with the selection, but this is a nagging doubt and will be picked up by the few skeptics trying to divide us all about the course of change over the last Is it possible to subdivide the North American borehole data into regions where we can be confident of no land-use changes (possibly and thinking aloud say Canada and the western US and Alaska) ? The aim of this (possibly joint work) is to try and reconcile the low- and high-freq Tom Crowley has a series for the NH where he's combined about 20 series (a few of which are in Mike's and the series we've produced here but he has over half the series from less-well resolved proxies - shallow marine and lake sediments) and he gets something very similar to Mike and As all our (Mike, Tom and CRU) all show that the first few centuries of the millennium were cooler than the 20th century, we will come in for some flak from the skeptics saying we're wrong because everyone knows it was warmer in the Medieval We can show why we believe we are correct with independent data from glacial advances and even slower responding proxies, however, what are the chances of putting together a group of a very few borhole series that are deep enough to get the last 1000 Basically trying to head off criticisms of the IPCC chapter, but good science in that we will be rewriting people's perceived wisdom about the course of temperature change over the past It is important as studies of the millennium will help to show that the levels of natural variability from models are Tom has run his EBM with current best estimates of past forcing (Be-10 as a proxy for solar output and Alan Robock's ice core volcanic index) and this produces a series similar to all series of the last 1000 The above is just ideas of how we, as a group, could/should try and reduce criticisms etc over the next year or Nothing is Your North American borehole series could be correct as it is annual and most of the high-freq proxy series respond mainly to summer Is yours really annual when there is a marked seasonal snow cover season ?

"Thanks Frank, My Sorry, no, I hadn't looked in detail at your original email to Ray, only his response, and simply wanted to note that others have already jumped on this bandwagon, so Ray deserves neither all the blame, nor all the glory, depending on your perspective :) And, as I stated, IPCC clearly considers such a plot not appropriate for prime time--so you won't see anything like this in the WHat I find most useful, howevever, along the lines of what you discuss, is using empirical reconstructions as a baseline for comparison against model simulations of both free and forced A number of studies have attempted this recently, and the results are encouraging from the point of view that (a) the coupled models appear to be getting the internal variability of mean global/hemispheric temperatures about right [this leads us in the direction of having greater faith in future scenarios from such models] and (b) the models,forced with paleoestimates of past volcanic, solar, and GHG radiative forcings, appear to be able to explain more than 50% of the variance in the paleo temperature A paper to appear in this Friday's ""Science"" by Tom Crowley describes some impressive results along these It is agreed that hydrological change and regional temperature anomalies superimposed on any large-scale temperature changes are of key importance from any practical point of And I think this is what we're all working towards, more regionally detailed reconstructions of climate fields (temperature, drought, slp, ) in past Clearly more high-resolution proxy evidence is necessary, in both time and I make many of these very points in a ""Perspectives"" article also to appear in Science on Friday, accompanying Tom Crowley's Will appreciate any comments on Hope the above provides some cheers, mike",0

"Beware of Social Security Myths April 27, 2016 Read our full Social Security myths paper here E Social Security is on the road to insolvency, with its trust fund proje cted to run dry within the next 18 years E At that point, tens of mill ions of seniors, dependents, and workers with disabilities who depend o n the program will face an abrupt and painful 21 percent cut in their b enefits E Yet too little of the discussion in Washington and on the ca mpaign trail has focused on the solutions necessary to fix Social Secur ity, and too much has focused on perpetuating myths that cloud the disc ussion E Today, the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget presents C Nine Social Security Myths You Shouldn t Believe E D Myth #1: We don t need to worry about Social Security for many years E Myth #2: Social Security faces only a small funding shortfall E Myth #3: Social Security solvency can be achieved solely by making the rich pay the same as everyone else E Myth #4: Today s workers will not receive Social Security benef its E Myth #5: Social Security would be fine if we hadn t Cra ided the trust fund E D Myth #6: Social Security cannot run a deficit E Myth #7: Social Security has nothing to do with the rest of the budget E Myth #8: Social Security can be saved by ending waste, fraud, and abuse E Myth #9: Raising the retirement age hits low-income seniors the hardest E Read our summary of a few of these myths below E Myth #1: We don t need to worry about Social Security for many years E Because the Social Security Trustees estimate the programs tru st funds will not become insolvent until 2034, many argue there is litt le need to rush reforms E But the reality is that the longer policymak ers wait to act, the harder it will be to fix the program E As we explain, waiting would literally make the problem larger E What could be solved by increasing taxes or reducing new benefits by about o ne-fifth today would require a one-third tax increase or a benefit cut larger than all new benefits if lawmakers wait until 2034 E Waiting al so reduces the number of options available and gives workers less time to plan and adjust for any change E Myth #3: Social Security can be fixed solely by making the rich pay the same as others E Because Social Security s benefit formula and 12 E4 percent pa yroll tax do not apply to wage income above $118,500 (indexed to wage g rowth), many have proposed increasing or eliminating this Ctaxa ble maximum D in order to make the program solvent E Certainly increasing the wages subject to the payroll tax will improve the program s finances, but those who argue it will achieve lon g-term solvency overstate the case E Depending on the details and esti mating agency, fully eliminating the taxable maximum will close 40 to 9 0 percent of the program s 75-year shortfall and only one-fifth to one-half of the program s long-term structural gap E This means further action would be needed to truly achieve sustainable solve ncy E Myth #8: Social Security can be saved by ending waste, fraud, and abuse E One popular idea to reduce Social Security spending is to eliminate imp roper and fraudulent payments within the program E Of course nobody li kes fraud, but there is little that anti-fraud measures can do to impro ve the program s solvency E The Social Security Administration estimates that improper payments tot al about $5 billion per year E Even if somehow all these payments coul d be ended, it would only address 3 percent of the $150 billion needed each year to make the program solvent E Myth #9: Raising the retirement age hits low-income seniors the hardest E Because life expectancy is higher for wealthier Americans, it seems int uitive that raising Social Security s normal retirement age (NR A) to above 67 would represent a larger cut for lower earners E Yet in reality, raising the NRA represents a roughly even reduction in benefi ts for all income groups E Raising the NRA is not regressive is because it does not affect eligibi lity but rather the size of the benefit reduction one receives for reti ring early E As we show in our paper, the Congressional Budget Office, Social Securi ty Actuary, Social Security s Office of Retirement Policy, and Urban Institute all calculate that increasing the retirement age to 68 results in at least as large (and in many cases larger) a percentage cu t for higher earners as for lower earners, on both an annual and lifeti me basis E Read our full Social Security Myths paper, and read the summary E For more information, contact Patrick Newton, press secretary, at newto user@domain Eorg E Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget 1900 M Street NW Suite 850 Washington DC 20036 United States If you believe you received this message in error or wish to no longer receive email from us, please 07988480/-3932347760778016768 E",0

"Dear Partners in Workpackage 1 of IMPRINT, today is the deadline by which Eystein requested input as regards the reworked (and necessarily much shortened), proposal We have also been making some effort to consolidate the indicative budgets that most of you have sent to We now need to transfer these figures to Eystein , even though a few partners have not supplied numbers to us , though they may have sent them to Eystein It is clear that we are now close to 30 partners in Workpackage 1 alone, and have indicative budget requests totaling well over the nominal 5 million Euro originally In fact , the likely total with all partner requests included is likely to be nearer to 10 million! We have been given a (very unofficial) hint from Brussels that an ""appropriate"" total project request of about 17 million for IMPRINT might be sensible , with a final figure , if the project ever gets accepted, of 15 million being possibly awarded (subject of course to referees' comments and subsequent reorganisation of priorities). The simple message is that Eystein will now have to make an executive decision as to the total amount requested . If we ever get that far, reorganised budgets will have to be decided on the basis of very specific work plans that will need to formalised for a second submission - especially as they relate to the justification for field work and new data We also need to budget for the involvement of non-partners , possibly using a mixture of workshop and minor funding awards to facilitate data collection It has been made clear that new practical work campaigns would not be sanctioned across all Tasks in Workpackage 1 . Rather, the bulk of work would involve re-dating/interpretation of mostly existing data and reconstructions of forcings and climate .

"Dear folks, I've been doing some calculations to address one of the statistical issues raised by the Douglass et paper in the International Journal of Here are some of my Recall that Douglass et calculated synthetic T2LT and T2 temperatures from the CMIP-3 archive of 20th century simulations (""20c3m"" runs). They used a total of 67 20c3m realizations, performed with 22 different In calculating the statistical uncertainty of the model trends, they introduced sigma{SE}, an ""estimate of the uncertainty of the mean of the predictions of the trends"". They defined sigma{SE} as follows: sigma{SE} sigma / sqrt(N - 1), where ""N 22 is the number of independent models"". As we've discussed in our previous correspondence, this definition has serious problems (see comments from Carl and Steve below), and allows Douglass et to reach the erroneous conclusion that modeled T2LT and T2 trends are significantly different from the observed T2LT and T2 trends in both the RSS and UAH This comparison of simulated and observed T2LT and T2 trends is given in Table III of Douglass et [As an amusing aside, I note that the RSS datasets are referred to as ""RSS"" in this table, while UAH results are designated as ""MSU"". I guess there's only one true ""MSU"" ] I decided to take a quick look at the issue of the statistical significance of differences between simulated and observed tropospheric temperature My first cut at this ""quick look"" involves only UAH and RSS observational data - I have not yet done any tests with radiosonde datas, UMD T2 data, or satellite results from Zou et I operated on the same 49 realizations of the 20c3m experiment that we used in Chapter 5 of CCSP As in our previous work, all model results are synthetic T2LT and T2 temperatures that I calculated using a static weighting function I have not yet implemented Carl's more sophisticated method of estimating synthetic MSU temperatures from model data (which accounts for effects of topography and land/ocean differences). However, for the current application, the simple static weighting function approach is more than adequate, since we are focusing on T2LT and T2 changes over tropical oceans only - so topographic and land-ocean differences are Note that I still need to calculate synthetic MSU temperatures from about 18-20 20c3m realizations which were not in the CMIP-3 database at the time we were working on the CCSP For the full response to Douglass et , we should use the same 67 20c3m realizations that they For each of the 49 realizations that I processed, I first masked out all tropical land areas, and then calculated the spatial averages of monthly-mean, gridded T2LT and T2 data over tropical oceans (20N-20S). All model and observational results are for the common 252-month period from January 1979 to December 1999 - the longest period of overlap between the RSS and UAH MSU data and the bulk of the 20c3m The simulated trends given by Douglass et are calculated over the same 1979 to 1999 period; however, they use a longer period (1979 to 2004) for calculating observational trends - so there is an inconsistency between their model and observational analysis periods, which they do not This difference in analysis periods is a little puzzling given that we are dealing with relatively short observational record lengths, resulting in some sensitivity to end-point I then calculated anomalies of the spatially-averaged T2LT and T2 data ( climatological monthly-means over 1979-1999), and fit least-squares linear trends to model and observational time The standard errors of the trends were adjusted for temporal autocorrelation of the regression residuals, as described in Santer et (2000) [""Statistical significance of trends and trend differences in layer-average atmospheric temperature time series""; JGR 105, ] Consider first panel A of the attached This shows the simulated and observed T2LT trends over 1979 to 1999 (again, over 20N-20S, oceans only) with their adjusted 1-sigma confidence intervals). For the UAH and RSS data, it was possible to check against the adjusted confidence intervals independently calculated by Dian during the course of work on the CCSP Our adjusted confidence intervals are in good The grey shaded envelope in panel A denotes the 1-sigma standard error for the RSS T2LT There are 49 pairs of UAH-minus-model trend differences and 49 pairs of RSS-minus-model trend We can therefore test - for each model and each 20c3m realization - whether there is a statistically significant difference between the observed and simulated Let bx and by represent any single pair of modeled and observed trends, with adjusted standard errors s{bx} and s{by}. As in our previous work (and as in related work by John Lanzante), we define the normalized trend difference d as: d (bx - by) / sqrt[ (s{bx}) 2 + (s{by}) 2 ] Under the assumption that d is normally distributed, values of d + or indicate observed-minus-model trend differences that are significant at the 5% We are performing a two-tailed test here, since we have no information a priori about the ""direction"" of the model trend ( , whether we expect the simulated trend to be significantly larger or smaller than observed). Panel c shows values of the normalized trend difference for T2LT the grey shaded area spans the range + to , and identifies the region where we fail to reject the null hypothesis (H0) of no significant difference between observed and simulated Consider the solid symbols first, which give results for tests involving RSS We would reject H0 in only one out of 49 cases (for the (T47) model). The open symbols indicate results for tests involving UAH Somewhat surprisingly, we get the same qualitative outcome that we obtained for tests involving RSS data: only one of the UAH-model trend pairs yields a difference that is statistically significant at the 5% Panels b and d provide results for T2 Results are very similar to those achieved with T2LT Irrespective of whether RSS or UAH T2 data are used, significant trend differences occur in only one of 49 Bottom line: Douglass et claim that ""In all cases UAH and RSS satellite trends are inconsistent with model "" (page 6, lines 61-62). This claim is categorically In fact, based on our results, one could justifiably claim that THERE IS ONLY ONE CASE in which model T2LT and T2 trends are inconsistent with UAH and RSS results! These guys screwed up big SENSITIVITY TESTS QUESTION 1: Some of the model-data trend comparisons made by Douglass et used temperatures averaged over 30N-30S rather than What happens if we repeat our simple trend significance analysis using T2LT and T2 data averaged over ocean areas between 30N-30S? ANSWER 1: Very The results described above for oceans areas between 20N-20S are virtually QUESTION 2: Even though it's clearly inappropriate to estimate the standard errors of the linear trends WITHOUT accounting for temporal autocorrelation effects (the 252 time sample are clearly not independent; effective sample sizes typically range from 6 to 56), someone is bound to ask what the outcome is when one repeats the paired trend tests with non-adjusted standard So here are the results: T2LT tests, RSS observational data: 19 out of 49 trend differences are significant at the 5% T2LT tests, UAH observational data: 34 out of 49 trend differences are significant at the 5% T2 tests, RSS observational data: 16 out of 49 trend differences are significant at the 5% T2 tests, UAH observational data: 35 out of 49 trend differences are significant at the 5% So even under the naive (and incorrect) assumption that each model and observational time series contains 252 independent time samples, we STILL find no support for Douglass et 's assertion that: ""In all cases UAH and RSS satellite trends are inconsistent with model "" If Leo is agreeable, I'm hopeful that we'll be able to perform a similar trend comparison using synthetic MSU T2LT and T2 temperatures calculated from the RAOBCORE radiosonde data - all versions, not just ! As you can see from the email list, I've expanded our ""focus group"" a little bit, since a number of you have written to me about this I am leaving for Miami on Monday, My Mom is having cataract surgery, and I'd like to be around to provide her with moral and practical I'm not exactly sure when I'll be returning to PCMDI - although I hope I won't be gone longer than a As soon as I get back, I'll try to make some more progress with this Any suggestions or comments on what I've done so far would be greatly And for the time being, I think we should not alert Douglass et to our With best regards, and happy holidays! May all your ""Singers"" be carol singers, and not of the Fred Ben ( I noticed one unfortunate typo in Table II of Douglass et The (medres) model is referred to as "" "" )",0

There may have been samples off the front that couldn't be dated at all, for all I I suspect though they are roughly the same calendar age, as the site has distinct dates for the start of trees, which represent regeneration Maybe you can try and explain the tree-line argument to When he had to omit parts of cores, he was always able to know where the two parts sat in the We need to keep them together to do things like Anyway, I have to go home - it's been very wet lately and the grass has The lawn must be mowed when the sun Keep pushing that he should write up what he does (and Ross) in proper E&E and Climate Research are not read by many I only look at them when I get alerted and I remain Cheers Phil Legates email Phil Jones has made a valid point in that some of the articles cited in my critique do not 'directly' address problems with Mann and Jones (MJ) but rather, address problems with earlier works by Mann, Bradley, and Hughes (MBH) and other Fair enough - I have changed the critique to reflect that The revised version has been posted since July 19 at: [1] However, I still contend that most of my original arguments - namely, the problems with the shaft, blade, and sheath - apply equally to Mann and Jones as well as the other Mann et manifestations of the 'hockey stick'. MJ incorporate data from a number of the same sources as those used by MBH; for example, Mann's unpublished PC1 from the western North American tree-ring data, Cook's Tasmanian tree rings, Thompson's Quelccaya and Dunde ice core oxygen isotope records (the latter embedded in Yang's Chinese composite), and Fisher's stacked Greenland ice core oxygen isotope Calibration and verification of MJ includes the flawed MBH Thus, any errors in MBH effectively undermine the calibration-verification results of MJ, leaving this study unsupported and any problems with the underlying common proxies identified in critiques of MBH will also result in identical problems in My criticism regarding the blade is that deg C warming for the last century is noted by the IPCC whereas MJ (and other M et al representations) have up to deg C warming in their observed See MJ's figure 2 where for the global and NH reconstruction, their estimates for 2000 exceed + and + (nearly + ), MJ's NH curve is included in the attached Thus, I stand by my criticism of MJ on this point, which is more egregious in MJ than other M et al From Jones: ""The trend over the 20th century in the Figure and in the instrumental IPCC quotes deg C over the 1901-2000 Fact - but Legates is eyeballing the curve to get deg A figure isn't given in Mann and Jones (2003). Take it from me the trend is about the same as the instrumental "" Funny, but there IS a figure in MJ - see their Figure As for me 'eyeballing' an apparently non-existent curve, I attach a figure from Soon et (2004) that contains a portion of MJ's Figure 2 to allow others to decide for themselves whether MJ suggest a twentieth century warming of deg C or deg Moreover, maybe someone can explain why every time Mann and his colleagues draft another curve, the temperature in 2000 gets warmer and warmer after the My criticisms regarding the sheath (largely from a paper on which I am working) stem from the characterization of the uncertainty by MJ that arises solely from the 'fit' statistics to the 1600-1855 period using cross-validation with, not observations, but composites of three previously compiled reconstructions, including that developed by MBH - the focus of known flaws and errors in the Note that some of the same data are used in both MBH and MJ, which doesn't allow for a truly independent My rather obvious point was not that fit statistics should not be included (as Jones asserts) but that MJ included no errors in either input realization (observations or proxy data) or other obvious sources of The claim by MBH and MJ is that only the model lack-of-fit contributes to uncertainty is inherently Considerable errors exist in the representation of both fields - annual temperatures from both observations and proxy records - and must be Clearly, there is a spatial bias associated with observations that are biased away from the oceans, high latitudes, and high The spatial problem is far more pronounced when only a handful of proxies are used to represent the global temperatures at earlier time Both MBH and MJ are equally guilty in this David Legates Several people have asked me for the full references to the works I have They are: Chapman, , Bartlett, and Harris (2004): Comment on 'Ground surface air temperature trends: Implications for borehole surface temperature reconstructions' by Mann and Geophysical Research Letters, 31, L07205, Esper, J, Cook, and Schweingruber (2002): Low-frequency signals in long tree-ring chronologies for reconstructing past temperature variability, Science, 295, Esper, J, Frank, and Wilson (2004): Climate reconstructions: Low-frequency ambition and high-frequency EOS, Transactions of the American Geophysical Union, 85 (12):113, IPCC TAR (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Third Assessment Report) (2001): Climate Change 2001: The Scientific Basis, Houghton, , Ding, , Griggs, , Noguer, , van der Linden, , Dai, , Maskell, , Johnson, ( ), Cambridge organization Mann, , Bradley, and Hughes (1998): Global-Scale Temperature Patterns and Climate Forcing Over the Past Six Centuries, Nature, 392, [see also the correction in Nature - Mann, Bradley, and Hughes, 2004] Mann, , Bradley, and Hughes (1999): Northern Hemisphere Temperatures During the Past Millennium: Inferences, Uncertainties, and Geophysical Research Letters, 26, Mann, , and Jones (2003): Global surface temperature over the past two millennia, Geophysical Research Letters, 30(15), 1820, doi: Mann, , and Schmidt (2003): Ground surface air temperature trends: Implications for borehole surface temperature Geophysical Research Letters, 30(12), 1607, McIntyre, , and McKitrick (2003): Corrections to the Mann et al (1998) Proxy Data Based and Northern Hemispheric Average Temperature Energy and Environment, 14, Pollack, , and Smerdon (2004): Borehole climate reconstructions: Spatial structure and hemispheric Journal of Geophysical Research, 109, D11106, Rutherford, , and Mann (2004): Correction to 'Optimal surface temperature reconstructions using terrestrial borehole data'.

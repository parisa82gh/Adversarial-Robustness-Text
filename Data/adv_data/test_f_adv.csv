" PRIMARY DAY TALKING POINTS Topline Message: Today as millions of Americans in five states go to the polls, Democrats are voting with enthusiasm for the candidate they like most -- Republicans are holding their noses and casting their votes for the candidate they dislike We expect that today we'll see the same thing we've seen throughout this campaign, our voters are energized with the serious and substantive primary we've had and two candidates who both have the judgment and temperament to serve; while Republican voters will continue to be dismayed with the chaos on their In the last primary in New York, exit polls showed that nearly 7 out of every 10 Democratic voters believe that our primary has energized our That's because our two candidates have consistently offered strong, well thought-out visions for our country that would move America That's consistent with Wisconsin where 7 out of 10 Democrats in those exit polls said they were excited or optimistic about both of our That's something we're not seeing on the Republican side where serious questions have been raised about their understanding of the issues, not to mention their judgment and temperament given how ugly, divisive and insulting they've Their own voters know Just 39% of Republicans in New York thought their campaign has energized their In Wisconsin 4 out of 10 Republican primary me say that primary voters said they fear what a Trump presidency would do to our And roughly a third would rather stay home, vote for a third party, or vote for a Democrat than support either Trump or That's stunning, but it tells you that Democrats are heading into November in a far stronger position than Talking Points Chaos in Cleveland vs Our Next President in Philadelphia We're less than 100 days from the July conventions, and it's clear that Democrats will emerge united, while Republicans are embroiled in drama better suited for a reality show than a contest for the Both Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders are dedicated to supporting the eventual Democratic Just yesterday, Senator Sanders said at a town hall on MSNBC that he will do everything in his power to make sure no Republican gets into the White House in And Secretary Clinton has been clear about her commitment to unifying the party and the need to build on the progress we've made under Democratic leadership over the last 7 Because the Party's platform is a statement of our values, the domain is committed to an open, inclusive and representative Both of our campaigns will be represented on the Platform Drafting Committee, and just as we did in 2008 and 2012, the public will have opportunities to Democrats know that we're stronger when more voices are heard, and when we stand together to move our country forward, we'll see that in Philadelphia at our We'll see our next President on our stage at the Democratic convention in Compare that to the This week, the increasingly desperate Cruz and Kasich campaigns forged an unusual alliance to stop Trump, but it barely lasted as long as the announcement that it was One-third of Trump supporters said they would abandon the Republican Party if he loses the nomination and runs as a third-party Even Republican leaders are afraid of going near their radioactive You've already seen Republican candidates in tight races, like Senator Kirk in Illinois and John McCain - the GOP nominee eight years ago - say they will not attend their own convention in But don't let them fool you, they're not any better than the top of their Joint Fundraising Committees We welcome any effort by our candidates to help raise money for the domain and state parties, which is why we stood up similar agreements for joint victory funds with both the Clinton campaign and the Sanders campaign early in the The domain is the only entity that will be able to closely coordinate with our eventual nominee, and we took these important steps because of the urgency to build a strong national infrastructure NOW that will help elect Democrats up and down the ballot in It's important to note, the funds that the domain and state parties get through the joint victory funds help strengthen, for example, our national voter file and communications, research and digital support for state parties and down ballot That includes training across a variety of areas, for example, and access to media monitoring and rapid response This is helping us build infrastructure for the general These arrangements are not new or Similar joint fundraising committees were established with our Democratic candidate in both 2008 and And again, both campaigns have signed on and have the option of using joint victory And let's be clear, neither the domain nor state parties are subsidizing fundraising through these committees for either For whatever each campaign raises under the agreement that then goes to their campaign, that campaign pays a directly proportional amount for the cost of that United Convention / Arizona Lawsuit We're going to be united at our convention, and we're confident in our process, which was in place well before we knew who would run this cycle and which has been fair to all of our We've cautioned our candidates to maintain a tone that helps us build toward the general election, recognizing that as we funnel down the home stretch of any campaign the intensity level will Ultimately, Secretary Clinton and Senator Sanders are drawing sharp differences with one another, but their differences remain focused on how to best move America o They're focused on how to make sure our government reflects the values of the American people, that we have an economy and a democracy that are inclusive, and that we respect everyone in If you want to talk about a rigged process, let's focus on the real problem we're seeing across the The Democratic National Committee and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee are suing officials in Arizona whose decisions led to voters having to wait for hours to vote during their March primaries, and many to be disenfranchised as a We want to make sure that doesn't happen in If you want to talk about rigging elections, that's the real example, and it's a serious problem and we're glad both our candidates have expressed interest addressing attempts to make it harder for the American people to In Maricopa County, officials reduced the number of polling locations to just 1 for every 21,000 That's seven times what it was in other parts of the state, and it shows you the magnitude of the efforts to make it harder to vote that Republicans are championing all across the And it's not just Arizona, you had a member of Congress from Wisconsin, Glenn Grothman, who flat out said that they expected they could now win Wisconsin because of the Voter ID It was his Kevin McCarthy moment, and the type of rigging of the system we're not going to put up When voters go to the polls in November, they can be certain that the Democratic nominee will have the temperament and judgment to serve as commander in chief, and that's not something you can say about the Republican GOP Frontrunner Trump is Reckless and Dangerous The Economy: Trump's unfounded predictions of recession and warnings against investing in the stock market are reckless, and economists have already predicted his policies could start an international trade war and cause a global Foreign Policy: Trump's threat to pull back from our most important military alliances in NATO sends a dangerous message, which is particularly troubling in light of his past praise of Russian President Vladimir Nuclear Proliferation: Trump has refused to say he wouldn't use nuclear weapons on European territory, then suggested South Korea and Japan should either develop nuclear weapons or pay the United States for protection against North On abortion: Trump has taken multiple positions on abortion - from a dangerous and offensive call to punish women who get an abortion, to saying he would allow states to restrict women's rights, to saying abortion laws are set but he would eliminate them with judicial Cruz The vast majority of his Republican colleagues can barely muster a straight face to say anything nice or positive about him! Lindsey Graham crassly talked about how no one in the Senate would object if he was killed on the Senate floor, and said that endorsing him over Trump was the equivalent of choosing to get poisoned over being Senator Jim Risch of Idaho - TWICE - gave one of the most passive, non-endorsement endorsements I've ever It's going to be very difficult for Senators and Congress members to run alongside a presidential nominee they really don't like! The GOP's Problem with Women Voters Trump is viewed unfavorably by 7 out of 10 women, but both of his primary opponents would also alienate women voters with their policies as the Kasich said that he wants to see Roe Wade repealed , and when asked what kind of punishment that would lead to, he evaded the question by saying that it should be left to the Cruz said that even if a woman has been brutally raped, she should be forced to carry the pregnancy caused by her attacker to In the past, the Republican candidates have opposed equal pay, family leave, and voted against the Violence Against Women Earlier this month we marked Equal Pay Day, the day in 2016 when women's earnings have caught up with men's earnings from On average we earn 79 cents to their dollar, and it's worse for women of All of the Republican presidential candidates would stand against protections that ensure greater equality in the John Kasich has consistently belittled women and said that we don't need workplace protections, just a 'change of heart' among major Ted Cruz voted against the Paycheck Fairness Act three times and ridiculed the legislation as a 'show ' Donald Trump stated that women would have pay equity if we did 'as good a job' as Republicans to Blame for Trump and His Down Ballot Impact It's fitting that Donald Trump is the standard-bearer of a party that has relied on divisive politics and scapegoating for electoral gain for so Since 2004 they've used gay marriage as a wedge issue, demonized immigrants and stoked fears about border They've given birthers like Trump a pass, and fueled the Tea Party with lies about a total government takeover of healthcare and the Then while in office, the only thing Republicans have done in Washington over the last seven years is Trump IS the Republican Advantage, Democrats Despite all the media attention that Republican frontrunner Trump gets with his say-anything strategy, Democrats are winning where it Senator Clinton has earned more than 10 million votes - Over a million more than Donald Trump - while Senator Sanders has earned more than 8 million votes (well ahead of Ted Cruz and John Kasich), while also garnering more than seven million individual campaign contributions from low dollar If there is an enthusiasm gap, it clearly favors Overall fundraising shows a Democratic edge, with Democrats raising a total of $ million in February and million in March, eclipsing Republicans' fundraising, which amounted to less than $12 million for Cruz, $6 million for Trump, and just $ million for Kasich in And while Trump continues to claim that he is self-funding his campaign, his latest report with the FEC shows that he has loaned his campaign $24 million throughout this election cycle, while he raising just $34 million from outside contributors and loans for the entire Democrats will have the strongest candidate in And we are poised to take back the Senate and make serious gains in the Broad Contrast and Infrastructure We have been building an infrastructure and operation that will work regardless of who the Republicans We see the numbers of course; it's clear Trump is far ahead of his competitors, and we're ready for him if he makes it through what is shaping up to be a train wreck of a But we don't think taking on Trump is fundamentally different from any of the At least with Trump, he's not shy about exposing what the Republican brand has truly Ted Cruz and John Kasich are every bit as extreme as their party's front-runner, they just hide it a bit They promise the same extreme agenda on women's rights, they deny the threat of climate change, and they oppose fixing a broken immigration system with a path to They all want to drag America back to the failed economic policies of the last Republican president who left office losing 800,000 jobs a month and having plunged our country into the Great And they've all been just as offensive in their rhetoric, using language that alienates our allies, helps ISIS recruit terrorists, and makes America less So if it is Trump, we're Maybe it's Cruz, but it's hard to see how that comes together in the But regardless we're building a ground game and an infrastructure that's ready to challenge him on every single position he's taking on the campaign trail, and that holds him accountable for what those positions would actually mean for the American [SigDems] Luis Miranda, Communications Director Democratic National Committee 202-863-8148 - user@domain - @MiraLuisDC ",0

"Dear Chapter 10, Sorry I missed out on the In general I like the proposed Figure and suggested Box contents (and I particularly agree that the diversity of downscaling methods and results precludes using them as a basis of consolidated regional conclusions). I also agree with others that it looks better with the +- signs However, there are 2-3 points that concern me, mostly from the perspective of climate scenarios (Chapter 13 - and also Chapter 9). - it needs to be made very clear if any numbers are cited in the Box ( 2-6degC for continental warming) that these refer to only one forcing scenario, namely 1% - rather than talk about GHG and SUL I would suggest the more conventional nomenclature of GG and GS (the SUL runs are not just SUL forcing of course, which might give that impression). - another very important caveat concerns the GS (SUL) results - these all stem from IS92a type aerosol forcing a la IPCC Most of the new SRES forcings used in TAR and Chapter 9 for example have much smaller or even positive SO4 forcing relative to In principle this could actually switch the sign of the changes in some There is the danger of inconsistency here between Chapter 9 (TAR aerosol effects) and Chapter 10 Box (SAR aerosol effects) if this is not carefully For example, in CAM and JJA it appears that aerosols switch the P change from 'strongly negative' to being 'uncertain' - but this is only for IS92a aerosol forcing: it is not a conclusion that would be valid for SRES aerosol forcing! - as Filippo says, another key uncertainty not represented in the Box is forcing uncertainty - again, Chapter 9 present a wide range of Tglobal results, part of which relates to prior assumptions about which SRES forcing We do a disservice if we give the impression in Chapter 10 Box that these regional responses are independent of what future forcing For example, under the lowest SRES forcing (B1) the response in some regions would revert back to being very small and therefore indistinguishable from - with regard to temperature and Filippo's comment, Chapter 9 has global maps of T change, averaged across the standard set of AOGCM experiments (ranges are also shown). This is in effect the information being sought-for by readers of Chapter 10 is it I would have thought that back-references in the Box to Figure would be See you all in Victoria, Mike",0
"Tom, I can't see why the data become b seems all that you can I reviewed the 2008 The version that I reviewed had something in for the problem of SST data now re drifters and ships, but they pulled that I recall saying it needed to be watertight and they needed to explain the spatial pattern to the ship minus drifter Maybe that version was a? I was never that keen on their It biases the values before the 1920s when you infill with anomalies that are nearer to You can see this in their This version is better than their previous I always assumed they still had gaps - as it would be impossible to infill the Antarctic and some parts of the Southern Have you tried looking at their Antarctic average - 65-90S for example? Their globe should be one domain, so not (NH+SH)/2 but for an infilled dataset this shouldn't make any I wonder if they downweight the infilled values in some way? They have their error field? The 2008 paper doesn't say how they compute Global and NH and Are NH and SH the same as you get? Cheers Phil",0

"Dear Mike, Thanks for your detailed response about your use of the SRES I'm sure it will be useful to Bob I wish I could explain better what Bob's problem entails -- it is intensely My judgement is that, if I tell you more, then this will indirectly help Bob in answering the questions posed of him by Sensenbrenner; particularly should Bob need to get back to Please note that this is confidential Please note, too, that I am making my own judgement on this in the interest of clarifying a complex I have not been authorized by Bob, or anyone associated with IPCC, to divulge this The stated concern of Sensenbrenner is that the use of the SRES scenarios prior to their ratification might, in some way, jeopardize IPCC's ""independence and objectivity"". Sensenbrenner apparently uses as guidelines in making his judgement ""IPCC's 'Principles' (as) approved in Vienna, Austria in October 1998"" together with ""June 11 and 28, 1999 letters"" giving ""Appendix A to the Principles, which is entitled 'Procedures for the Preparation, Review, Acceptance, Approval and Publication of IPCC Reports' (which was) approved in April 1999"". Sensenbrenner implies that these documents ""raise concerns about the use of preliminary IPCC material by Wigley and the Pew Center on Global Climate Change for non-IPCC purposes, apparently without IPCC sanction"". He considers that ""these issues (are) significant because they relate directly to the integrity of the IPCC process"". In my case, I bypassed the ""IPCC process"" by obtaining permission, in writing, from the 4 groups who produced the marker I did not acknowledge the CIESIN web In your case, apparently, you The problem here is that this site stated very clearly that the data were ""not for citation or quotation"". Did you take notice of this? My view is, and has always been, that contributors to such data sets or distribution sites do not give up the intellectual property rights to their own They could do so, of course, by signing appropriate legal/copyright documents; but I have never done this, nor, as far as I know, has anyone who contributed to the CIESIN This is why I went to the individual authors in order to obtain permission to use their data in my Pew I hope you can see that there is an important difference between what you did and what I At face value, it would appear that you have ignored the clearly-stated message that the CIESIN site data were ""not for citation or quotation"". (More on this point ) You refer back to the July 1998 Bureau meeting agreeing that the preliminary SRES scenarios (in your words) ""could, and should, be used by scientists"". From my reading of the background material, this is subtly wrong -- the Bureau only agreed that the data could be used by ""the GCM modeling community"". As it happens, I am part of that community, and I acted as the interface between the scenarios and the rest of the NCAR GCM team, providing SRES data to them in a form that could be used for our GCM I do not think you can claim to have filled this particular and quite specific role in your However, there are some interesting subtleties here that, I think, vindicate your The issue is what is meant by the ""GCM modeling community"". In my view, anyone who uses GCM data either to provide data sets to the impacts community or to carry out diagnostic studies directly to improve GCMs is part of this (Note that this does not allow one to include the impacts modelers as part of the GCM ) The two stated aspects are precisely what you Furthermore, SCENGEN (which I presume you have used in your work) makes direct use of GCMs in order to produce spatially-specific climate results based on any given emissions scenarios (including the SRES scenarios). The SCENGEN method is simply an alternative way of translating emissions scenarios into GCM-based and GCM-type In my view, anyone using the SRES scenarios in the development of SCENGEN, or applying SCENGEN to produce spatially-specific climate results for dissemination to others, must be included as part of the ""GCM modeling community"" referred to in the Bureau's agreement regarding use of the SRES You may have interpreted the Bureau's statements even more broadly than this -- but this is of no consequence, since what you have done also falls squarely within the more restricted interpretation that I have given Nevertheless, I think it would have been wiser for you to have done things the way I did, rather than to have acknowledged the CIESIN site as your The next issue, raised in your email, concerns the I have not looked at this site, but I presume it duplicates what was on the CIESIN If so, then its use (and the use of the preliminary SRES data) must be controlled by the rules under which the DDC was set up and The key questions, therefore, are: (1) Do these rules allow the use of these data by anyone? (2) Do the SRES data, as it appears on this site, include the statement ""not for citation or quotation""? (3) Does this make moot the whole issue of the use of the SRES scenarios? In other words, if these data are available to all and sundry, with no restrictions, through DDC, then no one can complain about their (Although, in your case, since you acknowledged CIESIN rather than DDC, you may still be subject to ) What this could amount to is a loophole in the IPCC rules of Sensenbrenner might then argue that this loophole should be closed by clarifying and tightening the rules for the The bottom line is that I think you have done things in a perfectly legitimate Even acknowledging the CIESIN site is legitimate, since your primary application was in the production of climate change scenarios as a member of the ""GCM modeling community"" as I believe this community should be You have then distributed these results to the global climate impacts community who, in turn, will be feeding their results back into the IPCC process through Your chosen method of distribution (especially the WWF pathway) might be judged as less than ideal; but I cannot see anything that you have done that goes explicitly or implicitly against IPCC Below the bottom line is the concern expressed by Sensenbrenner that these actions (yours and mine) might, in some way, have undermined the ""integrity of the IPCC process"". It would be interesting to hear from Sensenbrenner just how he thinks that might have All we have done is distribute credible and defensible scientific If this information were to be in conflict with the currently best-available science, this might be an issue of concern -- but it is The more such credible scientific information is distributed to the community, particularly when it is presented in an easily-read, non-technical yet authoritative way, the I can see no way that this can distort the IPCC Some people, however, appear to think that it (A less kind interpretation might be that they are just trying to slow down the process by tying it up in legal and procedural knots -- but I have no evidence that this is what they are trying to ) I hope you can see from the above quotes and somewhat convoluted arguments what a legal and political minefield this These sorts of issues do not seem to arise outside of the USA; but here they take on an enormous One must tread very Cheers, Tom",0

security at foreign ports with flights directly to the United States and allows the agency to help them out, The additions: language requiring the TSA to assess how well those foreign hubs share passenger name records, as well as provisions that would force the agency to request that its independent Aviation Security Advisory Committee report back with ideas for making passenger screening

"Hi David, thanks for the detailed I'll try to be On the orbital forcing you write: The point here is that climate can be forced by other factors than simply a global, annual average radiation change, which is the metric now being I think we all agree on this My concern is only about how to present it in the I think that giving a climate sensitivity global mean orbital forcing is confusing to the uninitiated, your statement in the section: This high climate sensitivity (2C/ Wm^-2) is occurring in an atmospheric model (ECHAM-1) whose sensitivity to doubled CO[2] is about ^ I really think we should not give a number like 2C/ Wm^-2 as ""climate sensitivity"" to global-mean orbital forcing and contrast it to that to doubled It gives out the message to people that climate sensitivity is all over the place and ill That's not the Climate sensitivity is a well-defined concept for a globally uniform forcing like CO2 forcing, but nobody expects any clear relation between the global mean part of orbital forcing and the climate On uncoupled models: I agree that for 2xCO2 runs, you will get very similar climate sensitivity with uncoupled and coupled models, because there is no large change in ocean heat transport between equilibrium 1x and 2x CO2 states (as confirmed by doing this in coupled models). The mixed layer boundary condition used in the uncoupled models simply assumes a fixed, prescribed ocean heat transport, which turns out to be a valid approximation in this My concern was and is specific to the discussion for LGM climate, where this is not a valid approximation, as we know both from proxy data and from model results that ocean circulation and heat transport was very likely quite different in the LGM compared to In our Nature 98 LGM simulation, we get 50% difference in the response of the Northern Hemisphere mean temperature, between the uncoupled ""mixed layer"" experiment and the one that includes the ocean 50% is a first-order difference, and hence I think that all the evidence we have today, points to the ""constant heat transport"" approximation breaking down when applied to the The IPCC report should not draw conclusions about climate sensitivity from LGM experiments that have made this approximation, as I think those would be hard to I must say I'm starting to get a little concerned about the chapter discussing 1980s papers for no other apparent reason then them being authored by Rind, while leaving out important more recent, widely recognised advances in the I attach the Schneider et paper I announced earlier, submitted to Science today and arguable the most comprehense study on deriving climate sensitivity from LGM data constraints that has been done so On the directionality of the cimate sensitivity: of course I understand the reasons, the ice feedback and water vapor feedback , I've written about those myself in the past - again this is only a difference in how best to present the same, undisputed You make the argument that when going to a colder climate, sensitivity is different from when going to a warmer That is But that in my view has nothing to do with the ""direction"" of the experiment, but with the fact that sensitivity in a colder climate is different from sensitivity in a warmer I explained with the ppm example because I thought that's A ""directionality"" would be, if going from 280 to 300 ppm would give a different equilibrium response compared to going from 300 to But that's not what you're talking Your talking about going from 280 to 260 (say), as compared to going from 280 to That of course gives different results, because the difference 280-260 applies to a colder climate than the difference 300-280 (no matter in which ""direction"" you derive this).

There may have been samples off the front that couldn't be dated at all, for all I I suspect though they are roughly the same calendar age, as the site has distinct dates for the start of trees, which represent regeneration Maybe you can try and explain the tree-line argument to When he had to omit parts of cores, he was always able to know where the two parts sat in the We need to keep them together to do things like Anyway, I have to go home - it's been very wet lately and the grass has The lawn must be mowed when the sun Keep pushing that he should write up what he does (and Ross) in proper E&E and Climate Research are not read by many I only look at them when I get alerted and I remain Cheers Phil Legates email Phil Jones has made a valid point in that some of the articles cited in my critique do not 'directly' address problems with Mann and Jones (MJ) but rather, address problems with earlier works by Mann, Bradley, and Hughes (MBH) and other Fair enough - I have changed the critique to reflect that The revised version has been posted since July 19 at: [1] However, I still contend that most of my original arguments - namely, the problems with the shaft, blade, and sheath - apply equally to Mann and Jones as well as the other Mann et manifestations of the 'hockey stick'. MJ incorporate data from a number of the same sources as those used by MBH; for example, Mann's unpublished PC1 from the western North American tree-ring data, Cook's Tasmanian tree rings, Thompson's Quelccaya and Dunde ice core oxygen isotope records (the latter embedded in Yang's Chinese composite), and Fisher's stacked Greenland ice core oxygen isotope Calibration and verification of MJ includes the flawed MBH Thus, any errors in MBH effectively undermine the calibration-verification results of MJ, leaving this study unsupported and any problems with the underlying common proxies identified in critiques of MBH will also result in identical problems in My criticism regarding the blade is that deg C warming for the last century is noted by the IPCC whereas MJ (and other M et al representations) have up to deg C warming in their observed See MJ's figure 2 where for the global and NH reconstruction, their estimates for 2000 exceed + and + (nearly + ), MJ's NH curve is included in the attached Thus, I stand by my criticism of MJ on this point, which is more egregious in MJ than other M et al From Jones: ""The trend over the 20th century in the Figure and in the instrumental IPCC quotes deg C over the 1901-2000 Fact - but Legates is eyeballing the curve to get deg A figure isn't given in Mann and Jones (2003). Take it from me the trend is about the same as the instrumental "" Funny, but there IS a figure in MJ - see their Figure As for me 'eyeballing' an apparently non-existent curve, I attach a figure from Soon et (2004) that contains a portion of MJ's Figure 2 to allow others to decide for themselves whether MJ suggest a twentieth century warming of deg C or deg Moreover, maybe someone can explain why every time Mann and his colleagues draft another curve, the temperature in 2000 gets warmer and warmer after the My criticisms regarding the sheath (largely from a paper on which I am working) stem from the characterization of the uncertainty by MJ that arises solely from the 'fit' statistics to the 1600-1855 period using cross-validation with, not observations, but composites of three previously compiled reconstructions, including that developed by MBH - the focus of known flaws and errors in the Note that some of the same data are used in both MBH and MJ, which doesn't allow for a truly independent My rather obvious point was not that fit statistics should not be included (as Jones asserts) but that MJ included no errors in either input realization (observations or proxy data) or other obvious sources of The claim by MBH and MJ is that only the model lack-of-fit contributes to uncertainty is inherently Considerable errors exist in the representation of both fields - annual temperatures from both observations and proxy records - and must be Clearly, there is a spatial bias associated with observations that are biased away from the oceans, high latitudes, and high The spatial problem is far more pronounced when only a handful of proxies are used to represent the global temperatures at earlier time Both MBH and MJ are equally guilty in this David Legates Several people have asked me for the full references to the works I have They are: Chapman, , Bartlett, and Harris (2004): Comment on 'Ground surface air temperature trends: Implications for borehole surface temperature reconstructions' by Mann and Geophysical Research Letters, 31, L07205, Esper, J, Cook, and Schweingruber (2002): Low-frequency signals in long tree-ring chronologies for reconstructing past temperature variability, Science, 295, Esper, J, Frank, and Wilson (2004): Climate reconstructions: Low-frequency ambition and high-frequency EOS, Transactions of the American Geophysical Union, 85 (12):113, IPCC TAR (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Third Assessment Report) (2001): Climate Change 2001: The Scientific Basis, Houghton, , Ding, , Griggs, , Noguer, , van der Linden, , Dai, , Maskell, , Johnson, ( ), Cambridge organization Mann, , Bradley, and Hughes (1998): Global-Scale Temperature Patterns and Climate Forcing Over the Past Six Centuries, Nature, 392, [see also the correction in Nature - Mann, Bradley, and Hughes, 2004] Mann, , Bradley, and Hughes (1999): Northern Hemisphere Temperatures During the Past Millennium: Inferences, Uncertainties, and Geophysical Research Letters, 26, Mann, , and Jones (2003): Global surface temperature over the past two millennia, Geophysical Research Letters, 30(15), 1820, doi: Mann, , and Schmidt (2003): Ground surface air temperature trends: Implications for borehole surface temperature Geophysical Research Letters, 30(12), 1607, McIntyre, , and McKitrick (2003): Corrections to the Mann et al (1998) Proxy Data Based and Northern Hemispheric Average Temperature Energy and Environment, 14, Pollack, , and Smerdon (2004): Borehole climate reconstructions: Spatial structure and hemispheric Journal of Geophysical Research, 109, D11106, Rutherford, , and Mann (2004): Correction to 'Optimal surface temperature reconstructions using terrestrial borehole data'.

"Dear colleagues, you may already know it: the EU FP5 second call for proposals is out since today ( ), as expected, and the deadline for submission is Feb The new call does indeed answer a question I have been wondering about when I heard from many first-call projects that they were asked to The present call is only for the slots that were, last year, declared to be opened at this stage (not for the previous slots). Probably the re-invited proposals then still bid for the old money (or at least, I hope so). There is however one important exception: "" Mitigation and adaptation to global change"". About this, the official document says ""re-open because of the quality of proposal received in reply to the call of 20 March 1999"". Further down, they point out that Kyoto really is tremendously important for the commission (""primary objective""), and then comes the following far-reaching sentence: ""If one takes into account the time lag between the research results, the political decisions and the actual emission reduction it is evident that the year 2000 is the last opportunity for research to cover the remaining analytical gaps of "" ( , page 6).

We can find the extra $$ to get folks to Boulder and have a quality time (do you ski?).

The White House is interested in knowing the state-of-the-art, and if we can get everything together at one www site (including data and figs), I think I can get some needed visibility for the paleo You probably know this, but Henry Pollack's Borehole view of things (similar conclusions to the other recent papers) is about to appear in Although each proxy and method does have it's limitations and biases, the multiproxy view is compelling with regard to the patterns of temp change over the past several The IPCC next time around should be much stronger than last on the paleo side of things (although still not as good as it can get!).

"Dear Keith, Bette and Eystein: This email should be read after the one to the entire team - it provides post LA3/TS feedback on Since Bette is going on a short vacation, she and I emailed about her new LIG fig before I left, so she's ready to go when she gets Keith (and Tim), on the other hand, have lots to consider, and I just wanted to reiterate to you (and Bette) that it's a priority for me and Eystein to help you brainstorm all these Here are a few more comments I got on Keith/Tim Figs: For 1) removing the oldest portion of the records from the plot is only ok IF: -we can justify on an obvious and objective basis - for example that sample depth hits goes down significantly at 700AD or wherever we want to chop -We don't remove part of the series that will give rise to accusations of bias Thus, it might be better to leave as was in the FOD, just to be safe, or to try multiple 2) had a long talk with Martin Manning about the idea of multiple plots, vs just the existing one (by the way, the TS team WANTS the instrumental part of the fig as we agreed to modify in Chap 6 sessions). I think the best idea is to keep the bottom panel as is, with modifications - keep the error bars as is - try a version with some sort of annually-resolved volc forcing placed at the top of the panel, with eruption (sufate) lines sticking down farther for big eruptions - try inserting some representation of average (median? or?) sample depth along the bottom (time) side of the This will thus show, lots of sample depth back to 1700, then less and less (in steps?). Martin suggests we go one step farther and color the sample depth part of the plot with different colors, based on our expert judgement of We could have two or three colors - one color for the interval overwhich we have ""very likely"" confidence ( , in the exec summary) and another for just "" "" perhaps we want a third for some term reflecting ""don't trust inferences regarding hemispheric temp that much over this interval"" - this will obviously take some thinking/creativity, but this fig will go all the way to the TSM, so it's worth the 3) linear axis for sure 4) if would still be good to try a density shaded version of this plot (instead of all the recon lines) for the TS and When in doubt, make an extra We can then share with our team and with Thanks for doing this!

At least in the period prior to 1600 I think these are the only methodological differences between both curves (?). My interpretation of this figure is also somewhat If the final reconstructions differs so strongly by using a longer calibration period (in general yielding stronger decadal variability in the reconstruction) I would tend to think that the method based on these proxies is quite What would happen if the calibration period could have been extended to 1800, for Page 15: The role of forcing on the global or NH T is also recognized in the correlation between the NHT simulated by ECHO-G and CSM for the For the case of a second ECHO-G simulation /Gonzalez-Rouco et ) the agreement is very close at 30-year Section 3, In my opinion, MM05 stress the inadequacies and uncertainties in the MBH work, but they not put forward their own reconstruction implying a warmer-than-today They believe that this is true, but in their works so far, at least to my knowledge, they do not assert that the MWP was warmer than present, only that the uncertainties are too large for such a Section 3: This paragraph may be Again what is the consensus? If we look at the recent NAS report, which again not every one would agree with, the 'consensus' is reduced to the past 400 years in comparison to IPCC, leaving ample space for speculation before this Does the NAS report belong to the consensus? perhaps partially, but I am not sure to what Section 3, discussion of MM05 and hockey-stick I have here a certain level of disagreement with these The issue raised by MM05 would be that the de-centering of the proxies prior to the calculations of the principal components tends to produce hockey-stick-shaped leading I think this effect is true, at least with spatially uncorrelated red-noise series . It can be easily verified and it has been recognized in the NAS, the Wegman report and by Francis To be fair, following this issue is the problem of the truncation- just to keep the leading PC or further Pcs down the hiercharchy, and if this is done, the final differences could be probably in the final But the paragraph implies, in my opinion, that this criticism by MM05 has no grounds, which as I said is problematic and could open the manuscript with criticisms based on these recent I think that the calculation shown in Figure 3 is very useful, as it boils down to the issue raised by MM05: how relevant is the de-centering and standardization with real Apparently, I get a different message from Figure3 (although I may have misinterpreted the text). I see quite large differences in the 20th century between the original MBH leading PC and the 'correct' calculation (whole period centering and standarization,blue line). Only the original MBH PC shows a positive trend in the 20th The blue lines seems even to show a negative trend or no trend at If this PCs were to be used in the MBH regression model (with trend included in the calibration) the results could be quite I would tend to think that this figure actually supports the MM05 criticism, since the hockey-stick shape of the leading PC Section 3, end, bristlecone I am also worried by this The recent NAS report clearly states that the bristlecone pines should not be used for reconstructions in view of their potential They cite previous analysis on this I think that to refer to just one study indicating no fertilization effect could not be However, I am not a This could open the door to potential Section 4 , years 1997 and onwards were the warmest in the I see here also potential problems with this claim, and I do not see the need to make our lives more The NAS report expressed that the uncertainties are too large for this type of conclusion and certainly this conclusion would attract some attention from the I see two lines of criticism on this: one is that the standard errors have been calculated with the calibration residuals and these are an underestimation of the true A reviewer may require that the uncertainty range be calculated by cross-calibration or In the case of CVM perhaps this effect is not very important, as there is just one free parameter, but in the case of inverse regression there are much many more free parameters and the true uncertainties can be quite different from those estimated from the calibration This potential criticism could be exacerbated by the fact that the new reconstruction has not been tested in a validation The other line of criticism could be that the calibration period has been, as in all reconstructions, a priori truncated -data after 1980 are not considered as the proxies are known to not follow the Strictly speaking this truncation can be only justified by a credible physical explanation about the cause of this Statistically, I think it is not correct to a priori ignore some data because they do not If one does so, I think the uncertainty range should be enlarged to encompass the possibility that this divergence could have happened in the past, an additional standard deviation of the instrumental NH T in the period 1980-2000 (or perhaps more correct, the square root of the sum of the error variance and the NHT variance in 1980-2000). Alternatively, one could include the period 1980-2000 in the calibration and due to the divergence the standard errors would grow, but perhaps this is practically not possible as the proxy time series may not have been archived for the last 20 Section 5, I share the worry of Anders Moberg about the wording 'serious flaws' in the analysis of This sentence would be based on Figure 3, if I understood properly, but as I said I think Figures 3 actually does not support this Finally, I think it would strategically better to avoid conflicts on the particular point of whether some particular year was the warmest of the millennium or not, and to stress the fact that all reconstructions, also the new ones presented in the manuscript (with one exception) show MWP temperatures lower than late 20th century Another conclusion could be, in my view, that the average temperature in the cold centuries in the millennium seems to be still quite The new reconstructions, or the calculation of the leading PCs of the proxies, seem to be still quite sensitive to particular choices in the statistical ",0

Cheers Keith Date: Thu, 16 Nov 2006 11:57:09 +0000 To: Martin Juckes , ""Myles Allen"" From: Keith Briffa Subject: Re: Mitrie: Bristlecones Cc: user@domain, user@domain, user@domain, user@domain, user@domain, user@domain Martin and all, I know Franco very well - but he has not worked extensively with the I still believe that it would be wise to involve Malcolm Hughes in this discussion - though I recognise the point of view that says we might like to appear (and be) independent of the original Mann, Bradley and Hughes team to avoid the appearance of In my opinion (as someone how has worked with the Bristlecone data hardly at all!) there are undoubtedly problems in their use that go beyond the strip bark problem (that I will come back to later). The main one is an ambiguity in the nature and consistency of their sensitivity to temperature It was widely believed some 2-3 decades ago, that high-elevation trees were PREDOMINANTLY responding to temperature and low elevation ones to available water supply (not always related in a simple way to measured precipitation) . However, response functions ( ie sets of regression coefficients on monthly mean temperature and precipitation data derived using principal components regression applied to the tree-ring data) have always shown quite weak and temporally unstable associations between chronology and climate variations (for the high-elevations trees at least). The trouble is that these results are dominated by inter-annual (ie high-frequency) variations and apparent instability in the relationships is exacerbated by the shortness of the instrumental records that restrict analyses to short periods, and the large separation of the climate station records from the sites of the Limited comparisons between tree-ring density data (which seem to display less ambiguos responses) imply that there is a reasonable decadal time scale association and so indicate a real temperature signal , on this time scale .The bottom line though is that these trees likely represent a mixed temperature and moisture-supply response that might vary on longer The discussion is further complicated by the fact that the first PC of ""Western US"" trees used in the Mann et analyses is derived from a mixture of species (not just Bristlecones ) and they are quite varied in their characteristics , time span, and effective variance spectra . Many show low interannual variance and a long-term declining trend , up until about 1850 , when the Bristlecones (and others) show the remarkable increasing trend up until the end of the The earlier negative trend could be (partly or more significantly) a consequence of the LACK of detrending to allow for age effects in the measurements (ie standardisation) - the very early sections of relative high growth were removed in their analysis, but no explicit standardistion of the data was made to account for remaining slow width changes resulting from tree This is also related to the ""strip bark"" problem , as these types of trees will have unpredictable trends as a consequence of aging and depending on the precise nature of each tree's structure . Another serious issue to be considered relates to the fact that the PC1 time series in the Mann et analysis was adjusted to reduce the positive slope in the last 150 years (on the assumption - following an earlier paper by Lamarche et - that this incressing growth was evidence of carbon dioxide fertilization) , by differencing the data from another record produced by other workers in northern Alaska and Canada (which incidentally was standardised in a totally different way). This last adjustment obviously will have a large influence on the quantification of the link between these Western US trees and At this point , it is fair to say that this adjustment was arbitrary and the link between Bristlecone pine growth and CO2 is , at the very least, Note that at least one author (Lisa Gaumlich) has stated that the recent growth of these trees could be temperature driven and not evidence of CO2 The point of this message is to show that that this issue is complex , and I still believe the ""Western US"" series and its interpretation in terms of Hemispheric mean temperature is perhaps a ""Pandora's box"" that we might open at our peril! What does Jan say about this - he is very acquainted with these issues? cheers Keith",0

"Phil Remember all the fun we had last year over 1995 global temperatures, with early release of information (via Oz), ""inventing"" the December monthly value, letters to Nature etc etc? I think we should have a cunning plan about what to do this year, simply to avoid a lot of wasted I have been discussing with David P and suggest the following: By 20 Dec we will have land and sea data up to Nov David (?) computes the December land anomaly based on 500hPa heights up to 20 We assume that Dec SST anomaly is the same as Nov We can therefore give a good estimate of 1996 global temps by 20 Dec We feed this selectively to Nick Nuttall (who has had this in the past and seems now to expect special treatment) so that he can write an article for the silly We could also give this to Neville Nicholls?? We explain that data is provisional and how the data has been created so early (ie the estimate for Dec) and also We explain why the globe is (or whatever the final figure is) cooler than 95 (NAO reversal, slight La Nina). Also that global annual avg is only accuirate to a few hundredths of a degree (we said this last year - can we be more exact, eg PS/MS or is this to big??) FROM NOW ON WE ANSWER NO MORE ENQUIRIES ABOUT 1996 GLOBAL TEMPS BUT EXPLAIN THAT IT WILL BE RELEASED IN We relesae the final estimate on 20 Jan, with a joint UEA/MetO press It may not evoke any interest by For questions after the release to Nuttall, (I late Dec, early Jan) we give the same answer as we gave Are you happy with this, or can you suggest something better (ie simpler)? I know it sound a bit cloak-and-dagger but its just meant to save time in the long Im copying this to DEP and CKF also for Cheers Geoff",0

"Clinton fundraising leaves little for state parties By Kenneth Vogel and Isaac Arnsdorf 05/02/2016 05:21 AM EDT In the days before Hillary Clinton launched an unprecedented big-money fundraising vehicle with state parties last summer, she vowed ""to rebuild our party from the ground up,"" proclaiming ""when our state parties are strong, we That's what will "" But less than 1 percent of the $61 million raised by that effort has stayed in the state parties' coffers, according to a POLITICO analysis of the latest Federal Election Commission The venture, the Hillary Victory Fund, is a so-called joint fundraising committee comprised of Clinton's presidential campaign, the Democratic National Committee and 32 state party The set-up allows Clinton to solicit checks of $350,000 or more from her super-rich supporters at extravagant fundraisers including a dinner at George Clooney's house and at a concert at Radio City Music Hall featuring Katy Perry and Elton The victory fund has transferred $ million to the state parties, but almost all of that cash ($ million, or 88 percent) was quickly transferred to the domain, usually within a day or two, by the Clinton staffer who controls the committee, POLITICO's analysis of the FEC records By contrast, the victory fund has transferred $ million to Clinton's campaign and $ million to the domain, which will work closely with Clinton's campaign if and when she becomes the party's And most of the $ million spent directly by the victory fund has gone towards expenses that appear to have directly benefited Clinton's campaign, including $ million for ""salary and overhead"" and $ million for web advertising that mostly looks indistinguishable from Clinton campaign ads and that has helped Clinton build a network of small donors who will be critical in a general election expected to cost each side well in excess of $1 The arrangement has sparked concerns among campaign finance watchdogs and allies of Clinton's Democratic rival Bernie They see it as a circumvention of campaign contribution limits by a national party apparatus intent on doing whatever it takes to help Clinton defeat Sanders during the party's primary, and then win the White But it is perhaps more notable that the arrangement has prompted concerns among some participating state party officials and their They grumble privately that Clinton is merely using them to subsidize her own operation, while her allies overstate her support for their parties and knock Sanders for not doing enough to help the ""It's a one-sided benefit,"" said an official with one participating state The official, like those with several other state parties, declined to talk about the arrangement on the record for fear of drawing the ire of the domain and the Clinton In fact, the domain, which has pushed back aggressively on charges that it is boosting Clinton at the expense of other Democrats, has advised state party officials on how to answer media inquiries about the arrangement, multiple sources familiar with the interactions told ""The domain has given us some guidance on what they're saying, but it's not clear what we should be saying,"" said the ""I don't think anyone wants to get crosswise with the national party because we do need their But everyone who entered into these agreements was doing it because they were asked to, not because there are immediately clear "" Some fundraisers who work for state parties predict that the arrangement could actually hurt participating state They worry that participating states that aren't presidential battlegrounds and lack competitive Senate races could see very little return investment from the domain or Clinton's campaign, and are essentially acting as money laundering conduits for And for party committees in contested states, there's another risk: they might find themselves unable to accept cash from rich donors whose checks to the victory fund counted towards their $10,000 donation limit to the state party in question - even if that party never got to spend the cash because it was transferred to the Sources working with the Hillary Victory Fund said the committee is sensitive to these concerns, and that state parties were asked to submit names of donors they wanted to save for Clinton's campaign and the domain argue that all Democratic politicians and state parties - even those that aren't enrolled in the victory fund - will benefit from its That's because the cash will go towards enhancing national voter data, and research and communications efforts that all state parties are entitled And Josh Schwerin, a spokesman for Clinton's campaign, suggested that a handful of key state parties last month received another $700,000 in transfers from the victory fund, and enjoyed other benefits from it that will be detailed in subsequent FEC (The latest reports only cover through the end of ) ""About $ million has already been transferred to state parties and there is an additional $9 million on hand that will be distributed over the coming months as state parties ramp up for the general election,"" he said in an He added that in April ""money raised through the HVF has started to be used to fund Democratic coordinated campaigns across the country, which will help strengthen the party and elect Democrats up and down the "" But Schwerin did not respond to follow-up questions about how much of the $700,000 in victory fund transfers to the state parties was subsequently transferred to the domain spokesman Mark Paustenbach pointed out that the national party committee ""offered to engage in the same joint fundraising efforts with all the major presidential candidates early in the cycle and we welcome the efforts of the candidates to help raise money for the domain and state parties now to ensure we can build out the infrastructure to win in "" Sanders' campaign late last year signed a joint fundraising agreement with the domain, but the committee has been largely Instead, after Sanders was chided by Clinton allies for not helping down-ballot Democrats, he sent out appeals to his vaunted email list that helped raise hundreds of thousands of dollars for a trio of progressive House candidates, who got to keep all the The Hillary Victory Fund, by contrast, allows the Clinton campaign to maintain tight control over the cash it raises and The fund represents by far the most ambitious use to date of a joint fundraising committee - and arguably one the most ambitious hard-dollar fundraising efforts in modern presidential Until 2014, the most an individual could have given to such a committee was $123, But in April of that year, the Supreme Court, in a case called McCutcheon FEC, struck down aggregate limits on total giving to federal campaigns, allowing maximum donations to as many different committees as a donor That paved the way for massive joint fundraising committees which could accept ever-larger checks based on how the number and type of committees that agreed to In the case of the Hillary Victory Fund, the maximum donation in 2016 is $356,100, based on maximum donations of $2,700 to Hillary for America for the primary election, $33,400 to the domain and $10,000 to the federal accounts of each of the 32 state After POLITICO revealed that the victory fund was asking for couples to donate or raise a whopping $353,400 in order to sit at a table with Clinton, George Clooney and his wife, attorney Amal Clooney, at a fundraiser last month in San Francisco, Clooney admitted that was ""an obscene amount of "" But he justified it by saying ""the overwhelming amount of the money that we're raising, is not going to Hillary to run for president, it's going to the "" According to the agreements signed by the participating committees, which were obtained by POLITICO, the money is required to be distributed, at least initially, based on a formula set forth in joint fundraising agreements signed by the The first $2,700 goes to Clinton campaign, the next $33,400 goes to the domain, and any remaining funds are to be distributed among the state But what happens to the cash after that initial distribution is left almost entirely to the discretion of the Clinton Its chief operating officer Beth Jones is the treasurer of the victory And FEC filings show that within a day of most transfers from the victory fund to the state parties, identical sums were transferred from the state party accounts to the domain, which Sanders' supporters have accused of functioning as an adjunct of the Clinton For example, the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party received $43,500 from the victory fund on 2, only to transfer the same amount to the domain that same The pattern repeated itself after the Minnesota party received transfers from the victory fund of $20,600 on 1 (the party sent the same amount to the domain the next day) and $150,000 on 4 (it transferred the same amount to the domain that day). That means that Minnesota's net gain from its participation in the victory fund was precisely $0 through the end of Meanwhile, the domain pocketed an extra $214,100 in cash routed through Minnesota - much of which the domain wouldn't have been able to accept directly, since it came from donors who had mostly had already maxed out to the national party A similar pattern transpired with most of the participating state As of March 31, only eight state parties (most of which were in battleground states such as Colorado, Florida, Nevada, New Hampshire and Virginia) had received more from the victory fund than was transferred from their accounts to the But even if state parties aren't getting to keep the victory fund cash, they benefit from money spent to enhance the domain's data, research and design services, said Jeremy Kennedy, the executive director of the Maine Democratic State Committee, which is a victory fund ""In my opinion, strengthening the state parties strengthens the domain and vice versa,"" Kennedy ""I'd be the first one to tell you if I felt "" His party received $59,800 from the victory fund, but transferred that exact amount to the domain, though Kennedy said he hopes that money will find its way back to benefit the party in While state party officials were made aware that Clinton's campaign would control the movement of the funds between participating committees, one operative who has relationships with multiple state parties said that some of their officials have complained that they weren't notified of the transfers into and out of their accounts until after the That's despite their stipulations in the banking documents that their affirmative consent was required before such transfers could be made from their But the operative said that the state party officials are reluctant to complain to the domain about the arrangement out of fear of financial ""Particularly the parties in states that are not competitive, they worry that the domain won't let them keep any of the money, but the historical reality is that they wouldn't have gotten the money anyway,"" the operative Asked about whether the victory fund has taken steps to keep the state parties apprised of the transfers, Schwerin said, ""We work closely with all parties involved and all transfers occur in accordance with the joint fundraising "" Amalgamated Bank - the union-run bank that handles the accounts for the victory fund, as well as Clinton's campaign and the domain - did not directly address the complaints about money being transferred without consent of the state party ""We do not comment on the account activity of any customers other than to say that all clients enjoy the highest standards of security protocols and safeguards to ensure only listed account owners or their designated agents are able to execute transactions of any kind and, of course, always in full compliance of all banking laws,"" said bank spokesman Loren Another area in which critics contend the Hillary Victory Fund appears to be pushing the bounds of joint fundraising is in its online advertising campaign, which has included many ads urging readers to ""Stop Trump"" or to support While joint fundraising committees are allowed to pay for ads as part of their fundraising efforts, they are forbidden from funding campaign advertising urging voters to vote for or against specific Those types of ads qualify as electioneering expenses that are supposed to be paid for directly by the campaign or by party Schwerin said the ""Stop Trump"" ads aren't urging readers to vote against ""All of HVF's activities, including online ads, are for fundraising purposes,"" he Most of the victory funds ads were executed by the same firm that does advertising for Clinton's campaign, Bully Pulpit Interactive, which has been paid $ million by the Hillary Victory Fund for online advertising, and $ million by Hillary for America for online advertising and media Those victory fund ads, as well as a direct mail campaign funded by the same committee, ""appear to benefit only [the Clinton campaign] by generating low-dollar contributions that flow only to HFA, rather than to the domain or any of the participating state party committees,"" charged Sanders' campaign lawyer in an open letter sent to the domain in It alleged that the victory fund was essentially a pass-through to allow Clinton to benefit from contributions that far exceed the amount that her campaign could legally In a news release accompanying the letter, Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver argued ""it is unprecedented for the domain to allow a joint committee to be exploited to the benefit of one candidate in the midst of a contested nominating "" Clinton's campaign manager Robby Mook called the letter a ""shameful"" and ""irresponsible"" fundraising ploy, and urged Sanders to ""think about what he can do to help the party he is seeking to "" To view online: To change your alert settings, please go to or email was sent to user@domain by: POLITICO, LLC 1000 Wilson Arlington, VA, 22209, USA To unsubscribe,",0

"Trump rejects new adviser's push to make him 'presidential' By Kenneth Vogel and Eli Stokols 04/26/2016 05:21 AM EDT Donald Trump is bristling at efforts to implement a more conventional presidential campaign strategy, and has expressed misgivings about the political guru behind them, Paul Manafort, for overstepping his bounds, multiple sources close to the campaign tell Trump became upset late last week when he learned from media reports that Manafort privately told Republican leaders that the billionaire reality TV star was ""projecting an image"" for voters and would begin toning down his rhetoric, according to the They said that Trump also expressed concern about Manafort bringing several former lobbying colleagues into the campaign, as first reported by Now Trump is taking steps to return some authority to Manafort's chief internal rival, campaign manager Corey Neither Lewandowski nor Manafort responded to requests for comment, though Manafort on Sunday during an interview on Fox News blamed Lewandowski's regime for shortcomings in the campaign's delegate wrangling Lewandowski's allies responded by privately questioning whether Manafort has done anything to improve the They grumble that Manafort has spent a disproportionate amount of time on television - just as Trump himself has been avoiding the Sunday morning talk show circuit at Manafort's ""I think it pisses him off that he was getting free television by going on the shows and now Paul Manafort is out there resurrecting his career,"" said one campaign Citing Manafort's advocacy within the campaign for an expensive advertising push in upcoming states, the operative said Trump is ""saying I can get on every show I want for free and you're telling me not to do that and that I should pay for my advertising? That doesn't pass the smell test to "" The mounting tension comes as Trump is struggling to incorporate traditional political tactics with the cult-of-personality approach that helped him climb from long shot to front-runner for the GOP In some ways, Manafort and Lewandowski represent the id and the ego of that balance, with the hardscrabble outsider Lewandowski earning Trump's trust early, only to be challenged by the more polished insider brought in late last month to provide help as Trump's campaign struggled to secure loyal convention Manafort, sensing a far-reaching mandate, moved quickly to consolidate power, overhaul the campaign and rein in the Trump has acquiesced to a number of changes that appear to have Manafort's fingerprints, from practicing reading from a teleprompter to opening up his wallet to hire staffers and approving a major TV ad buy in California next month, while announcing a series of more substantive policy addresses, starting with a foreign policy speech on Wednesday in ""Paul is not being 'reined in,'"" said one Manafort ally working closely with the campaign, who acknowledged that Trump is still ""calibrating"" his ""He'll find his comfort zone in this "" But campaign insiders say it has become increasingly clear that Trump, for all his boasts about his ability to become more ""presidential,"" is simply unwilling or perhaps unable to follow through, and resents efforts to transform ""Everyone coming in now thinks they're going to be able to manhandle him and he's not going to let it happen,"" said an operative close to ""These consultants are used to being smarter than their candidate and in this scenario, the candidate is smarter and willing to risk more than you "" After Trump's resounding victory in last week's New York primary, for instance, Manafort handed the candidate a speech he'd written for him that aimed for a more presidential tone, according to two campaign Trump took a quick look at it and told Manafort he'd consider using such a speech down the road, but in the glow of his huge win in his home state, he preferred to wing Nonetheless, Trump's focus during the speech on job creation and his references to his leading GOP opponent as "" Cruz"" (rather than his mocking moniker of ""Lyin' Ted"") seemed to indicate he at least incorporated Manafort's main points). Then, later in the week, Trump expressed concern after learning about Manafort's moves to bolster the campaign by bringing on associates from his lobbying days, as well as his pitch to leery Republican Party In leaked audio from a presentation to the Republican National Committee, Manafort suggested that Trump's bombastic campaign trail rhetoric was just ""projecting an image"" to win over ""The image is going to change,"" Manafort said on the Around the same time, POLITICO revealed that Manafort brought in a handful of operatives who had ties to his lobbying firm, which had developed a niche representing a roster of controversial international clients who have been collectively described as ""the torturers' "" In particular, multiple sources said Trump was bothered by news stories about Manafort's representation of Saudi Arabia and for a group accused of being a front for Pakistani ""I don't think he was aware of the extent of the work that Paul has done in foreign countries that have not always been friendly to the United States,"" said a Washington operative with close relationships to the The operative pointed out that since Manafort joined the campaign, it has continued to struggle to keep pace with Cruz's superior operation to recruit delegates free to back their preferred candidate if a first ballot at a contested convention yields no Citing Trump's poor showing in delegate battles over the weekend in Kentucky, Maine, Minnesota, South Carolina and Utah, the operative said ""this is the narrative that Trump has tried to get away from and that was supposed to be Paul's "" During his Sunday appearance on Fox News, Manafort appeared to shift blame for recent losses to the campaign's original core staff, explaining ""most of the conventions that happened yesterday were set in state - stages a month or two ago and before frankly I was "" Multiple sources said that Trump in recent days has re-empowered Lewandowski to handle the campaign's finances and make some hiring decisions, partially reversing changes Manafort laid out this month when seizing some decision-making authority from Lewandowski was responsible for the campaign's recent hiring of former Chris Christie campaign manager Ken McKay, who is working on delegate operations but is seen as an ally of Lewandowski's, according to campaign And at his campaign appearances in the days since Manafort's appearance at the RNC, Trump has served notice that he isn't about to change his ""If I acted presidential, I can guarantee you this morning, I wouldn't be here,"" Trump said Saturday in Waterbury, On Monday, as he again mocked the idea of behaving in a more ""presidential"" manner at two rallies in Pennsylvania, Trump called John Kasich a ""slob"" after calling attention to his penchant for eating too much on the campaign trail and blasted him and Cruz, whom he called ""an ass,"" for ""colluding"" to stop him - every broadside delivered in his trademark vernacular and an implicit rebuke to those handlers looking to rein him ""That's If you try to force him into a box, he's going to climb out of the box just to prove it to you,"" said one operative close to the ""If you say he's going to be more presidential, all you did is make him less "" To view online: To change your alert settings, please go to or email was sent to user@domain by: POLITICO, LLC 1000 Wilson Arlington, VA, 22209, USA To unsubscribe,",0

"Dear Chris, cc: Doug Mike McCracken makes a fair I am no expert on the observational uncertainties in tropospheric SO2 emissions over the recent past, but it is certainly the case that the SRES A1B scenario (for instance) as seen by different integrated assessment models shows a range of In fact this has been an issue for us in the ENSEMBLES project, since we have been running models with a new mitigation/stabilization scenario ""E1"" (that has large emissions reductions relative to an A1B baseline, generated using the IMAGE IAM) and comparing it with A1B (the AR4 marker version, generated by a different IAM). The latter has a possibly unrealistic secondary SO2 emissions peak in the early 21st C - not present in the IMAGE E1 scenario, which has a steady decline in SO2 emissions from The A1B scenario as generated with IMAGE also show a decline rather than the secondary emissions peak, but I can't say for sure which is most likely to be ""realistic"". The impact of the two alternative SO2 emissions trajectories is quite marked though in terms of global temperature response in the first few decades of the 21st C (at least in our HadGEM2-AO simulations, reflecting actual aerosol forcings in that model plus some divergence in GHG forcing). Ironically, the E1-IMAGE scenario runs, although much cooler in the long term of course, are considerably warmer than A1B-AR4 for several decades! Also - relevant to your statement - A1B-AR4 runs show potential for a distinct lack of warming in the early 21st C, which I'm sure skeptics would love to see replicated in the real (See the attached plot for illustration but please don't circulate this any further as these are results in progress, not yet shared with other ENSEMBLES partners let alone published). We think the different short term warming responses are largely attributable to the different SO2 emissions So far we've run two realisations of both the E1-IMAGE and A1B-AR4 scenarios with HadGEM2-AO, and other partners in ENSEMBLES are doing similar runs using other Results will start to be analysed in a multi-model way in the next few CMIP5 (AR5) prescribes similar kinds of experiments, but the implementation details might well be different from ENSEMBLES experiments wrt scenarios and their SO2 emissions trajectories (I haven't studied the CMIP5 experiment fine print to that extent).

My concerns are two-fold, and I think these echo all of our The first is the fact that the papers are simply bad science and the conclusions are The second is that the work is being used quite openly for political As scientists, even though we are aware of the second issue, we need to concentrate on exposing the scientific We also need to do this in as authoritative a way as I do not think it is enough to speak as individuals or even as a group of recognized Even as a group, we will not be seen as having the 'power' of the Harvard stamp of What I think is necessary is to have the expressed support of both AGU and It would also be useful to have Harvard disassociate themselves from the Most importantly, however, we need the NAS to come into the With these 4 institutions, together with us (and others) as experts, pointing out clearly that the work is scientific rubbish, we can certainly win this I suggest that we try to get NAS to set up a committee to (best option) assess the science in the two BS papers, or (less good, but still potentially very useful) assess the general issue of the paleo record for global- or hemispheric-scale temperature changes over the past 1000 The second option seems more likely to be acceptable to This is arguably an issue of similar importance to the issue of climate sensitivity uncertainties which NAS reviewed earlier this year (report still in preparation). I am not sure how to fold AGU and AMS into this -- ideas are Similarly, perhaps some of you know some influential Harvard types better than I do and can make some suggestions The only way to counter this crap is to use the biggest guns we can The Administration and Congress still seem to respect the NAS (even above IPCC) as a final authority, so I think we should actively pursue this Best wishes, ",0

"Dear Tom, I'm inclined to agree with Some people are accessible to rational scientific They are good Bayesians - when confronted with new scientific information, they are capable of modifying previously-held John Christy is not accessible to rational scientific New evidence does not cause him to change his He simply claims that the new evidence is From John's perspective, any datasets in disagreement with UAH-based estimates of tropospheric temperature change constitute ""bad data"". John is incapable of recognizing and admitting that Douglass et used a flawed statistical test to reach incorrect He continues to misrepresent the analyses we performed in our response to Douglass et I don't see what useful purpose can be served by trying to engage him in reasonable scientific At the Hawaii IPCC meeting in March, John stood up in front of an audience of IPCC Working Group I Lead Authors and attempted to portray himself as a victim of scientific He claimed that his ""alternative"" views on the nature and causes of climate change were being ignored by the mainstream scientific This claim is The ""mainstream"" scientific community has not ignored the ""alternative"" views of folks like John The sad reality is that we've wasted an inordinate amount of time responding to the flawed science and incorrect claims of John and his I'm hopeful that I won't have to waste much more time on the ""great satellite debate"". In my personal opinion, we're already well past the point of diminishing returns on this The point of diminishing returns was reached three years ago, when you overcame great obstacles to lead a fractious bunch of scientists to the successful completion of the first CCSP With best regards, Ben",0

"Hi Phil, SOrry that you have taken such a negative spin from I had hoped it was all resolved pretty amicably, and emphasized to Keith and Tim that I was being perhaps overly picky this time PRECISELY to avoid the misunderstanding that happened last time around w/ Trust that I'm certainly on board w/ you that we're all working towards a common That is what is distressing about commentarys (yours from last year, and potentially, without us having had approprimate input, Keith and Tim's now) that appear to ""divide and conquer"".

In fact, your piece was references in several commentaries (mostly on the WEB, not published) attacking our So THAT is what this is all It is in the NAME of the common effort we're all engaged in, that I have voiced concerns about language and details in this latest commentary--so as to avoid precisely that Please understand the above to be a complete and honest statement about the source of my It really doesn't have anything to do about who did what first, I trust that history will give us all proper credit for what we're doing The millennial-scale trend issue appears to be a source of Malcolm can address the replication issue better than any of us--it's not a problem w/ our Furthermore, WE HAVE EXPLICITLY TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT THE LOSS OF LOW-FREQUENCY VARIANCE IN OUR ESTIMATES OF I don't know how many times I need to stress It is of fundamental importance in framing our Our own analysis convinces me that things are already quite uncertain a millennium back in With regard to longer timescale variations, the evidence is all over the At EGS I saw some convincing evidence that many new paleo proxies indicate steadily decline at least over several millennia, and so do, in large part, the available long borehole estimates (though we should all take that w/ a good dose of NaCl). So I'm skeptical of estimates more than a millennium back in time until we have multiple proxies we can trust at that timescale, and can verify somehow the DC component of the estimates, or at least replicate This was my concern about the latest 2000 year recon that was You are right, the Milankovitch forcing argument is ONLY A NULL I hope I haven't argued anything more than That our millennial scale trend, which we reasonably trust, and have some idea of the uncertainties in, is in line w/ that null hypothesis is information that cannot be That Kutzbach, Berger, and others are showing increasingly convincing model integrations over several millennia suggesting this, is more In the real word, anything could have But lets not loose site of the appropriate null hypothesis I hope the above clears things up I'm sorry things have been construed in more negative light than I had ever Call me anytime to discuss, here at the office (not sure how well our schedules overlap though).

"Hi Keith and all, (please everyone have a look at point (4)) I think section is in remarkably good shape (certainly compared to my ). There are some comments from me: (1) About the new proxy reconstructions, the section says: ""Most of these are "" in the This immediately raises the question: why not all? Which one is not shown? This section will be scrutinised with great suspicion by some people, so we need to be Can you clarify which one you left out, and why? Or can we just write: ""These are "" That would be much (2) Several times you say ""simply scaled"" - would ""scaled"" do as well? The ""simply"" in this context sounds a bit like we criticise (3) Is ""predictand"" a word that everybody knows? I'd never seen it (4) Now here is my biggest question, that I think we need to discuss in the whole Figure shows simulations of the past millennium, relative to 1500-1899 Is this really the best reference period? Contra: it differs from how we show the data reconstructions, , relative to Everyone knows what that climate actually was, since there are good instrumental data for 1961-1990, so that it makes sense to look at changes relative to that Nobody knows what the real 1500-1899 mean was, so this is a fictitious Pro: it gets rid of ""end effects"", model initialisation problems at the beginning (as in Von Storch 04), and different anthropogenic forcings used at the end ( some ignore aerosols); the simulations look closer together in this way (right?) I have not formed a clear opinion on what is (5) Also on the figures: I like the grey bands, but here's a suggestion for improvement: instead of leaving the core region between those two bands white, I think they should also be shaded - either the same grey, or a darker shade of This makes it more clear that we are talking about one, wide uncertainty band here, not about two seperate It had me confused at first when I saw it, even though I was there when we discussed this in Final point: we need to keep an eye on developments concerning the model tests of the proxy method, there seem to be several important things in the pipeline Cheers, Stefan",0

"This is an excellent idea, Mike, IN PRINCIPLE at In practise, however, it raises some interesting results (as I have found when attempting this myself) that may be difficult to avoid getting bogged down with The attached .pdf figure shows an example of what I have produced ( please don't circulate this further, as it is from work that is currently being finished off - however, I'm happy to use it here to illustrate my point). I took 7 reconstructions and re-calibrated them over a common period and against an observed target series (in this case, land-only, Apr-Sep, 20N - BUT I GET SIMILAR RESULTS WITH OTHER CHOICES, and this re-calibration stage is not critical). You will have seen figures similar to this in stuff Keith and I have See the coloured lines in the attached In this example I then simply took an unweighted average of the calibrated series, but the weighted average obtained via an EOF approach can give similar The average is shown by the thin black line (I've ignored the potential problems of series covering different periods). This was all done with raw, unsmoothed data, even though 30-yr smoothed curves are plotted in the The thick black line is what I get when I re-calibrate the average record against my target observed THIS IS THE IMPORTANT The re-calibrated mean of the reconstructions is nowhere near the mean of the It has enhanced variability, because averaging the reconstructions results in a redder time series (there is less common variance between the reconstructions at the higher frequencies compared with the lower frequencies, so the former averages out to leave a smoother curve) and the re-calibration is then more of a case of fitting a trend (over my calibration period 1881-1960) to the observed This results in enhanced variability, but also enhanced uncertainty (not shown here) due to fewer effective degrees of freedom during Obviously there are questions about observed target series, which series to include/exclude , but the same issue will arise regardless: the analysis will not likely lie near to the middle of the cloud of published series and explaining the reasons behind this will obscure the message of a short EOS It is, of course, interesting - not least for the comparison with borehole-based estimates - but that is for a separate paper, I My suggestion would be to stick with one of these options: (i) a single example reconstruction; (ii) a plot of a cloud of reconstructions; (iii) a plot of the ""envelope"" containing the cloud of reconstructions (perhaps also the envelope would encompass their uncertainty estimates), but without showing the individual reconstruction best How many votes for each?

"Trump campaign eyes #NeverTrump blacklist By Kenneth Vogel and Ben Schreckinger 05/13/2016 05:11 AM EDT Donald Trump's campaign is considering hitting his Republican enemies where it hurts: Their As Trump moves to work in closer concert with the Republican National Committee apparatus, some campaign aides and allies are pushing him to block lucrative party contracts from consultants who worked to keep him from winning the nomination, according to four sources familiar with the ""The Never Trump vendors and supporters shouldn't be in striking distance of the RNC, any of its committees or anyone working on behalf of Donald Trump,"" said a Trump campaign The blacklist talk - which sources say mostly targets operatives who worked for Never Trump groups, but also some who worked for Trump's GOP presidential rivals or their supportive super PACs - strikes against a Republican consulting class that Trump has assailed as a pillar of a corrupt political It's a sweet bit of turnabout for Trump aides and consultants who in recent months were warned that their work for the anti-establishment billionaire real estate showman could diminish their own career If Trump's team makes good on the blacklist, it could elevate a whole new crop of vendors, while penalizing establishment operatives who attacked him, often in deeply personal But it also could put Trump's campaign at a competitive disadvantage as it scrambles to quickly beef up capabilities in highly technical campaign tactics that it largely eschewed in the primary, including voter data, direct mail and phone Newly minted presidential nominees typically install staff at their respective parties' national committees, and have been known to steer contracts to at least some of their favored vendors, which often provokes Since Trump all but clinched the GOP nomination this month with a lopsided victory in Indiana's primary, his staffers including political director Rick Wiley have spent considerable time at the RNC's Capitol Hill headquarters discussing joint fundraising and field The Trump campaign did not respond to questions about preferred Sources in and around the campaign told POLITICO that the campaign was not going to try to enforce a blanket blacklist for all consultants who opposed Trump, but rather would make contracting decisions on a case-by-case basis, with those associated with harder-hitting attacks more likely to be Some of the consultants and firms that worked against Trump are industry leaders in their respective fields, including strategist Katie Packer, pollster the Tarrance Group, online fundraiser Campaign Solutions and data vendors TargetPoint and Targeted Together, the consultants and firms this year have been paid at least $432,000 by the leading anti-Trump super PAC, Our Principles PAC - which pales in comparison to the $16 million their firms have collected over the years from the RNC - according to a POLITICO analysis of Federal Election Commission Packer, who helped run Our Principles PAC, said she has ""no interest in working for (Trump), nor do those I know who worked against him,"" so it wouldn't bother her one bit to be on a Trump ""I just hope they put me at the top and spell my name correctly,"" she said, adding, ""Winning a presidential election is They should focus on that and worry about settling scores if they "" But TargetPoint, which has been paid at least $156,000 this year by Our Principles PAC, as compared to at least $ million over the years by the RNC, would welcome the chance to continue its relationship with the national party during Trump's campaign, said Brent Seaborn, a partner at the ""We have built a lot and have a lot planned, and I would hate to see that not developed, so I certainly hope that we continue with that work,"" he Officials from the Tarrance Group and Campaign Solutions declined to say whether they would work for a Trump-led Zac Moffatt, president of Targeted Victory, said that his firm merely rented email lists to Our Principles, for which it has been paid $22,000 through the end of March, the period covered by the most recent FEC The firm has been paid more than that - $141,000 - by the Trump campaign for processing online donations, Moffatt pointed out, though he acknowledged it was more involved in the presidential campaign of Trump's bitter rival Ted Cruz, which paid $ million to Targeted Victory for digital advertising and Nonetheless, Moffatt said he hopes Targeted Victory will be able to play a role in the general election with the RNC, which over the years has paid the firm $ million, with the party's convention committees paying Targeted Victory another $208,000 to assist with their web That includes $8,000 from the 2016 convention committee for setting up a Tumblr ""Of course we would work for the RNC under Trump,"" said ""He is our nominee and we have been building our 120-plus-person company to prepare for the general for the past four I would think the party and the campaign would want to best team available to complement their efforts where they see "" RNC chief strategist Sean Spicer said that senior Trump campaign officials have assured him there is no list of firms they do not want the party committee to ""There has been no discussion of not using any vendors, pro or con,"" he But some of Trump's close allies are publicly accusing Republican leaders, including RNC chairman Reince Priebus, of trying to block Trump's campaign from making RNC contracting decisions, partly by withholding key endorsements like that of House Speaker Paul Ryan, with whom Trump met Thursday at the ""This is really about the money at the RNC,"" Trump confidant Roger Stone alleged in a little-noticed online interview this ""Millions and millions and millions of dollars that Reince and Ryan want to hand out to favored vendors, so they are going to try to game plan They're going to try to barter Paul Ryan's endorsement in return for financial control and autonomy for the RNC, the Republican National That would be an egregious mistake, in my But this is part and parcel of the establishment effort to slow down Donald "" The doling out of lucrative contracts to well-connected firms is a perennial source of friction in Washington In past years, contracts awarded by the RNC to FLS Connect LLC while its former partner Rich Beeson served as the committee's political director have come under scrutiny, as have contracts awarded to operative Blaise Hazelwood's husband when Hazelwood worked at the RNC and the National Republican Senatorial ""This is again one of those issues that the RNC has to be cognizant of because those old, cozy relationships are part of the problem, and Trump has effectively run on that,"" said Michael Steele, a former RNC chairman who made discontent with the committee's handling of vendor relationships a theme of his campaign for that ""You're probably going to see a lot of that stuff get exposed or dealt with in some "" But another GOP digital strategist cast these political consulting blacklists as He pointed to the relationship between an anti-Trump super PAC and a firm co-founded last year by Gerrit Lansing before he became the RNC's Chief Digital The firm, an online payment platform called Revv, processed donations at , the website for Never Means Never PAC, an anti-Trump group seeded with $100,000 from Pierre Omidyar, the founder of Ebay and First Look Lansing has had no ties to Revv since joining the RNC last He did not respond to a request for ""With Revv doing Never Trump, you have to ask yourself is the RNC on the blacklist, too?"" asked the ""The idea of a blacklist doesn't make any sense because 1 it's ill-informed and 2, it doesn't reflect the "" Plus, the Trump camp's desire for revenge could run up against the businessman's pledge to surround himself with the best In the case of Lansing, who worked at the National Republican Congressional Committee before the RNC, Trump appears to be a In February 2013, the New York billionaire tweeted, ""I am hearing that @NRCC Digital Director @lansing is doing great work expanding and modernizing @GOP social Good -

Even if we may not want to have different discount rates (since this upsets the underlying neoclassical paradigm), we may just ask the modellers to ensure that the results are not sensitive to A more interesting issue concerning the discount rates for our scenarios is that the different futures (scenarios) would have different associated discount The sustainable development type scenarios ( B1 scenario) may have lower discount rate than our A If we run all scenarios with same discount rate, this would be a I know there are no easy answers around this since we do not want to confuse the users of scenarios later on with too many different However it may be worth providing different specifications for important parameters or caveats where we anticipate Given the recent developments in East Asia, it may be worth to take a relook at A1 scenario and consider whether the Tiger World would transit to A1 or This is just an Wishing you a very happy new Shukla Shukla, Professor Indian Institute of Management, Vastrapur, Ahmedabad 380015, India Phone: 91 79 407241, Fax: 91 79 6427896 Email: user@domain, ~shukla ",0

"Hi Keith and Eystein - thanks for the timely and helpful (very) feedback, Your suggestions for 4 and 5 seem fine, and I wonder only about I too am not sure where the final clause came from, but I'll guess it was a suggestion of Stefan's that then stood the text of In the spirit of trying hard not to change the meaning of bullets in the ES from what the LA team agreed to in Bergen, what about changing this clause in the ES to read ""natural recovery"", and it is very unlikely that this warming was merely a natural recovery from the pre-20th century cold "" This takes away the ambiguity, and does serve to address a widely held misconception outside of our community - or at least to phrase the issue in terms that some might find more If we keep this phrase, then I would suggest restating the entire ES sentence at the end of Is this ok? Again, I'm motivated by our team agreement - I do think we could delete this phrase since it's more repetitive than new meaning, but would rather not unless it really does not Personally, I like it as modified above, because it hammers the important point from a slightly different perspective - one that seems to be on the minds of the public Thanks, both, for letting me know what you think best, peck Hi Peck and Eystein In response to Points 4-6 Add the following after past 1300 on line 13 page Y-33 ""Considering the recent instrumental and longer proxy evidence together, it is very likely that average Northern Hemisphere temperatures during the second half of the 20th century were warmer than any other 50-year period in the last 500 "" Do not put anything in Box which is written frolm the reverse perspective - evidence of medieval period not good enough to say warmer than Also confuses statements about 500 years and longer (1000 year ) Medieval , The person who says this has not read the text - see lines 28-33 on Y-32 where I think this is well If you read the text on lines 1-10 of PAGE Y-38 I think this meaning is clearly It is not in the same words -but easily supports the ES HOWEVER, I do not like the last part of the statement (and not sure where this came from) because it is ambiguous and anyway implied by prior I strongly urge you to remove the section ""and it is very unlikely that this warming was merely a recovery from the pre-20th century cold "" These would sort things out I believe cheers Keith",0

They will never agree to a time limit on the agreement the deal with Mark would not end until the IGT deal finally THIS IS THE BIG On 6A(1), they want 20% until December 31, (I think that if SPT agreed to no termination date, they would agree to 20% until December 31, 2024). On 6A(2), the 10% continues until the IGT deal finally On 6A(3), the 10% continues until the IGT deal finally 6A(4) would be On 6B, they want to be sure that the indemnity provisions survive, that Pollack retains audit rights and the right to secure copies of records relevant to conducting an They are confused as to 6B(3), and would want to discuss the length of such an agreement and what provisions would If SPT/SPCP is free to use Pollack or not, they do not understand why any end date is So, in the event SPT accepted such a deal, what would SPT have achieved? Paid 7 of the 14 million as a When the 2024 deal ends, reduce Pollacks deal on gambling monies to 10%. Reduce non-gambling monies to 10% now and going Limit the deal to WOF and Jeopardy! and no other Pollack to consult only upon SPT request non audit related records not sent to Confidentiality obligation I have asked our outside counsel to revisit the issue of whether SPT can legally terminate the deal at the end of 2024 and to revert to me this I want to better understand our chances although any decision would be by an arbitrator, not in ",0

I suggest to review completely the text, so that we can correct this before sending it to Third, I am seeing that you are changing the prices of the modulesand for this, I would do a different approach(meaning Im not OK with it :-))I suggest not to change the price It should be The price list and the price for each module cannot be changed to the benefit of one specific customer / market, etcOtherwise, it is like having NO price I suggest is to maintain the same price AND provide discounts in order to adapt to specific customer / market This approach has the advantage of keeping the same price list AND adapting to specific You also gain Customer by providing him a discount (he should be happy), and not putting your price So for instance:the Master Node should stay always at 220KIf you want to propose it for 150K, then you leave the price of 220K in the table and you should put a discount at the end of the table (before the total) of - 70K, in order to arrive to the same amount of 150KSame for the Collectors: 2 are priced 140K, so 1 collector should be 70K minimum or even 80K, because you only purchase oneIf you want to propose the price of 60K, then it is a -10K additional discount at the anonymizers should be 50K, not 30K, because 6 anonymizers are 100KAnd so on for the Console, the Physical Vectors, the 10 concurrent agents, etc In summary, we should have only one price list ! it has to be Then we create specific configurations for specific customer, and we can adapt providing specific discounts So for RAB, the price list of their system should be kept at around or above (depending of the module) the price of790K - 160K discount 630 (if you want to keep this price for the customer). In the table you can add a line of SUBTOTAL, then add a line of SPECIAL DISCOUNT, then complete the line of The same for the Professional Provide a discount instead of changing the I dont mind if the discount is hugeOur price list should be high, even if our proposal are at a lower priceYou gain from positioning high price AND providing discounts (even before negotiations).

The pdf is worth getting for a couple of sentences, when he said that MJ restricted their use of paleo series to those that had correlations with instrumental data ! It is a 'Our uncertainty estimates are based solely on how well the proxy records match the observed data' !

I'm the CLA of the atmospheric chapter with Kevin Trenberth and we'll be looking for Contributing Authors to help the Lead Authors we Paleo is in a different section this time led by Peck and Eystein Keith is a lead author as Phil Jones has made a valid point in that some of the articles cited in my critique do not 'directly' address problems with Mann and Jones (MJ) but rather, address problems with earlier works by Mann, Bradley, and Hughes (MBH) and other Fair enough - I have changed the critique to reflect that The revised version has been posted since July 19 at: [1] However, I still contend that most of my original arguments - namely, the problems with the shaft, blade, and sheath - apply equally to Mann and Jones as well as the other Mann et manifestations of the 'hockey stick'. MJ incorporate data from a number of the same sources as those used by MBH; for example, Mann's unpublished PC1 from the western North American tree-ring data, Cook's Tasmanian tree rings, Thompson's Quelccaya and Dunde ice core oxygen isotope records (the latter embedded in Yang's Chinese composite), and Fisher's stacked Greenland ice core oxygen isotope Calibration and verification of MJ includes the flawed MBH Thus, any errors in MBH effectively undermine the calibration-verification results of MJ, leaving this study unsupported and any problems with the underlying common proxies identified in critiques of MBH will also result in identical problems in My criticism regarding the blade is that deg C warming for the last century is noted by the IPCC whereas MJ (and other M et al representations) have up to deg C warming in their observed See MJ's figure 2 where for the global and NH reconstruction, their estimates for 2000 exceed + and + (nearly + ), MJ's NH curve is included in the attached Thus, I stand by my criticism of MJ on this point, which is more egregious in MJ than other M et al From Jones: ""The trend over the 20th century in the Figure and in the instrumental IPCC quotes deg C over the 1901-2000 Fact - but Legates is eyeballing the curve to get deg A figure isn't given in Mann and Jones (2003). Take it from me the trend is about the same as the instrumental "" Funny, but there IS a figure in MJ - see their Figure As for me 'eyeballing' an apparently non-existent curve, I attach a figure from Soon et (2004) that contains a portion of MJ's Figure 2 to allow others to decide for themselves whether MJ suggest a twentieth century warming of deg C or deg Moreover, maybe someone can explain why every time Mann and his colleagues draft another curve, the temperature in 2000 gets warmer and warmer after the My criticisms regarding the sheath (largely from a paper on which I am working) stem from the characterization of the uncertainty by MJ that arises solely from the 'fit' statistics to the 1600-1855 period using cross-validation with, not observations, but composites of three previously compiled reconstructions, including that developed by MBH - the focus of known flaws and errors in the Note that some of the same data are used in both MBH and MJ, which doesn't allow for a truly independent My rather obvious point was not that fit statistics should not be included (as Jones asserts) but that MJ included no errors in either input realization (observations or proxy data) or other obvious sources of The claim by MBH and MJ is that only the model lack-of-fit contributes to uncertainty is inherently Considerable errors exist in the representation of both fields - annual temperatures from both observations and proxy records - and must be Clearly, there is a spatial bias associated with observations that are biased away from the oceans, high latitudes, and high The spatial problem is far more pronounced when only a handful of proxies are used to represent the global temperatures at earlier time Both MBH and MJ are equally guilty in this David Legates",0

"Dear Evelyn and Chris, proposal review GC04-203, Meko et ""A synthesis of 19th century climate data for the United States from paleo, archival and instrumental sources"". I have read the ""Reviewer conflict of interest and "" document and can state that I have no conflict of interest and will abide by the confidentiality provisions I reviewed a very similar proposal by this group 1 year ago, and enclose my review of that proposal The new proposal has taken into account my two main concerns from last time, which were: (i) that creation only of a blended data set that contained a time varying mixture of proxy and instrumental data would limit the usefulness because its quality would be time varying, perhaps in an unquantified way, and independent study of errors between proxy and observed data would be prevented; and (ii) that the proposed work was not very innovative in terms of the applications for which the new information would be Both of these points have been addressed adequately and so I now rate it ""Excellent (5)"" for scientific/technical merit, and ""High (5)"" for importance/relevance and One issue that I would like to raise, however, is that the need for quantifying uncertainty/error in the reconstructions/database is not given much coverage in the It is mentioned, but not focused For many applications (testing models, comparison with other reconstructions, detection of unusual climate trends/events), explicitly quantified error estimates are These often change magnitude through time, and thus should be estimated in such a way as to allow They may also change with time scale (often being lower for, , a decadal mean than for a single year's value), and again the error estimation method should capture I do not think that this issue detracts from the quality of the Instead I am mentioning it in the hope that this comment can be passed on to the proposers, in the event that the project is funded, so that they can be prompted into placing the appropriate emphasis on quantifying Apologies for being late yet again, and best regards, Tim Date: Thu, 24 Oct 2002 17:14:31 +0000 Subject: confidential assessment of GC03-512 From: Tim Osborn To: CC: , Dear Irma and Chris, proposal review GC03-512, PI: David Meko ""A 19th century data catalog"" First of all, I confirm that there is no conflict of interest Now to my (1) Scientific Merit Rating: Good Comments: I completely agree with the rationale behind improving data sets of 19th century climate (see my comments below on ""Relevance to climate change programme""), and the proposers have identified the most relevant data sources available for the The objectives and workplan are generally reasonable, but I have rated it ""good"" rather than ""very good"" or ""excellent"" because it does not seem as scientifically innovative or challenging as it Some particular concerns are highlighted I am very wary about the proposed approach of integrating the data sources together to produce a single climate Obviously the data sources have to be used in combination, for calibration of proxy data or for assessment of possibly dubious early instrumental data, but combining them all into a single product only will be very restrictive for future use, assessment, Much better would be to produce intrumental-only series for whatever length is available, and tree-ring only series for the full length ( , into the late 19th and 20th centuries, despite the availability of instrumental data for these periods). Blending them into a single analysis is of some, but limited, use and comparisons of different periods and with ( ) model simulations can only ever be done by taking into account error bars that vary dramatically in time and are only estimates of the ""true"" errors - and the error estimates may be underestimates if based only on residuals or covariances during the 20th No mention is made of using the 19th century data to consider key issues such as difference between tree-ring and ground borehole temperatures (they differ more in the 19th century, in terms of trend, than in other centuries), possibly taking into account land-use No mention is made of using the 19th century data to assess multi-century temperature reconstructions and why they These are issues of great No mention is investigating seasonal dependence of temperature changes, which are greater in existing temperature products during the 19th century than in the 20th century and which has important implications for the calibration of proxy (including tree-ring) data against summer or annual data and the need to more clearly define the true seasonal response of proxy Despite these concerns, the proposed work is certainly worthy of funding and the extra items of interest that I mention above could be achieved using the data generated here, in some future (2) Relevance to climate change programme Rating: High Comments: The 19th century is certainly of particular importance, not just for the reasons outlined in the proposal but also because this century shows some of the biggest disagreements in warming trend between various quasi-hemispheric temperature reconstructions and between proxy and instrumental data and between different seasons of instrumental Additional data sources are definitely required, and additional digitisation, homogenisation and intercomparison of data sets is For these reasons, work such as that proposed here is essential for helping to refine answers to questions such as how unusual is late twentieth century climate and detection of climate change signals against the noise of natural climate Best regards Tim",0

"Dear CLAs/LAs As you all know, in my Victoria follow-up e-mail of 2 August I presented a summary of the agreement we reached in Victoria on a common use of terminology to express degree of likelihood in the At that time the word or term to be used for the central box of 33 to 66% had not been agreed and the word ""inconclusive"" was proposed for that Since that time there has been a lengthy discussion, including Working Groups II and III, regarding the best word to be used in this To cut a long story short the term we would now like you to use for this middle category is ""medium likelihood"". I am sorry I have not been able to canvas this around all of you but from the discussions this term was agreed by all to be the best In particular, it clearly maintains the scale as one of degrees of likelihood, whereas inconclusive could be confused as to whether a degree of likelihood was being expressed or whether there was insufficient information to conclude a I attach a table showing what should now be the final During the discussions it became clear that in addition to making likelihood statements it is sometimes more appropriate to express statements in terms of a degree of confidence, and indeed several chapters use this As you know the Uncertainties Guidance paper by Richard Moss and Steve Schneider recommends a scale of confidence from Very Low to Very High WGII in particular are using this scale and so I would ask that, if you choose to express things in terms of a level of confidence, that you use the terms as they are laid down in the guidance This in no way affects the use of the likelihood scale where this is more For example, if we are highly uncertain how well a model handles a particular process, we may have ""very low confidence"" in a model result which is highly dependent on this If we have no other corroborating evidence we may therefore conclude that there is insufficient information to assign a likelihood in this By following the guidance paper when expressing a level of confidence we will hopefully improve the consistency between the two Incidentally, if there are instances in the WGII report where they are able express degrees of likelihood they are going to try and use our Thirdly, there has been a lot of discussion about the impression which the likelihood scale, if taken out of context, could give for low likelihood, high consequence events, such as a disintegration of the WAIS or a shutdown of the THC in the next Please bear in mind that policymakers must balance likelihood and consequence in deciding whether or not to take Therefore please take extra care when considering text for these types of issues as simply expressing them as ""extremely unlikely"" does not give the full For example, you could say an aircraft was ""extremely unlikely"" to crash on its next flight but if there was a 1% chance I would not fly on While it is a true statement the right balance is only achieved when the consequence is also brought in to put the risk in I apologise for this late change to our scale but I hope you all agree that it is an If anything is not clear about any of the above please do not hesitate to contact Best regards Dave ",0

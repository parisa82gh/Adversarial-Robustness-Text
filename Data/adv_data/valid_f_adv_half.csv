"Hi Fortunat and friends - I suggest that we (Fortunat, can you do this?) ask Thomas Stocker since he has lots of experience w/ IPCC and knows what we're trying to do Is this ok? If it's ok (and I'm guessing that it might not be ok to use an unpublished extended solar series, as Fortunat suggest - but it would be more comparable to other results in the same figure (our old )), I think scaling to Bard would be better since this is what has been done more in the other simulations published and in the old - am I correct? If we can't scale Judith's new recon back to 1000, then we'll just have some simulated series back to Again, thanks Fortunat for figuring it all best, peck",0

Surprisingly, Ben is not yet, nor am But David Thompson is (quite young for one of these). I'm guessing Mike Wallace and Susan Solomon might have had something to do w/ that ;) Anyway, I wanted to check w/ you on two things: One thing that people sometimes like to know is the maximum value of ""N"" where ""N"" is the number of papers an individual authored/co-authored that have more than N N ( , an individual has published at least 40 papers that have each been cited at least 40 times) is supposedly an important threshold for admission in the National Academy of I'm guessing your N is significantly greater than that, and it would be nice to cite that if Would you mind figuring out that number and sending--I think it would be useful is really sealing the Would you mind considering a minor revision of your 2 page In my nomination letter, I'm trying to underscore the diverse areas where you've made major contributions, and I think its well known and obvious to many that two of these are instrumental data and paleoclimate But it occurs to me that it is equally important to stress your work in detection of anthropogenic impacts on climate w/ both models and For example, your early Nature papers w/ in '80 and '81 seem to be among the earliest efforts to try to do this (though I don't have copies of the papers, so can't read them!), and that seems very much worth highlighting to My suggestion is that you add a category on ""Anthropogenic Climate Signal"" detection and include this work (say, 8 or so of the key papers in this area including the two early Nature one's w/ Wigley) as well as some of your later work w/ I realize that most of your work in this area isn't as primary author, but I do think it would be helpful to show this side of your research, and I'd like to incorporate that into my nomination letter ( how critical your efforts have been to developments in areas such as D&A). You could still fit this onto 2 pages by making the font smaller for the references (10pt rather than 11 pt) while keeping the headings at 11 pt, and if necessary you could probably sacrifice a few of the surface temperature record references to make space for the additional Also, if you happen to have pdfs of the two early Wigley papers, or even just the text for the abstracts, it would be great to have a little more detail about those papers so I can appropriately work them into the narrative of my thanks for any help, mike please tell Keith I was very sorry he was unable to make it here to Trieste, I was really looking forward to seeing him (as were Ed and many others here).

"Sulfur Emissions in New IPCC Scenarios Arnulf Gruebler, IIASA SUMMARY OF PROPOSED ACTIVITIES Review and comments of present sulfur discussion paper Revision by sulfur paper lead author Preparation of comparison of regional sulfur scenarios (by lead author with inputs from other members of writing team and experts) Timing: August Specification of minimum and desirable sulfur emission scenario characteristics and specification (for modeling teams in open process) Establishment of key relationships between sulfur emissions and other salient scenario driving force variables (income, technological change environmental, non-GHG policies) using the simple metric of sulfur to carbon emission Adoption of specific sulfur control scenarios in conformity with overall scenario ``storylines''. Distribution of ``template'' sulfur scenarios to selected modeling teams for assessment of climate and acidification impacts of sulfur Timing: End of DISCUSSION PAPER Introduction The purpose of this discussion paper is to review briefly the assumptions on sulfur emissions in the IS92 IPCC scenarios, advances in knowledge and modeling of future sulfur emission scenarios since IS92, as well as to initiate a discussion on how to incorporate future sulfur emissions trends into the new IPCC emissions The present draft will be revised based on feedback received within the members of the IPCC writing team as well as additional outside Sulfur emissions in IS92 The treatment of sulfur emissions in the IS92 scenarios was In addition to the dominant energy sector emissions, also sulfur emissions from industrial processes and land-use changes (biomass burning) and (a constant flow) of natural sources were included in the 1990 base year values in IS92 were as follows in MtS (Million tons, or Tg, elemental sulfur; to obtain weight as SO2 multiply by ): Energy Sector: 65 MtS Other Industry: 8 MtS Biomass burning: 2 MtS Natural: 22 MtS TOTAL: 98 MtS These global base year values are well within the range given by global sulfur emission inventories of 4 to 45 MtS natural sources and 65 to 90 MtS anthropogenic sources in 1990 (IPCC, 1995:135-141). A comparison of 1990 base year sulfur emission values from a number of scenarios and integrated assessment models is enclosed as However, as observed in the evaluation of the IS92 scenarios (Alcamo et , 1995) regional sulfur emissions assumed in IS92 ( for China) are much more There is for instance up to a factor two difference between regionalized estimated of global inventories and aggregates of national and regional emissions Thus, the good agreement of base year values of IS92 at the global level masks important differences and uncertainties at the regional A first important task for the new IPCC scenarios is therefore to update the regional sulfur emissions baseline values with the results of latest regional sulfur emissions Such inventories are available for Europe through EMEP and CORINAIR, North America (NAPAP), and more recently also for Asia ( the Worldbank sulfur project, Foell et , 1995). Improved modeling of regional sulfur emissions (and deposition, impacts) patterns would also require a redefinition of the world regions as used in the IS92 scenario For instance, Canada is included in the region OECD-Europe, and the IS92 region ""South Asia"" includes both the Indian subcontinent as well as Their important differences in resource endowments lead to different patterns of sulfur Their differing predominant weather patterns and distinct ecosystems lead to differing acidic deposition patterns and Both factors preclude their aggregation into one single regional Active inputs from representatives of all respective modeling communities (regional acidification impacts, regional climate modelers, energy systems analysts) will be sought on this issue and lessons learned within EMF activities ( Schlesinger) on appropriate sulfur regionalization (6 world regions) will be extremely Concerning future emissions of sulfur the IS92 scenarios project global anthropogenic emissions of between 150 to 200 MtS by 2050 and between 140 to 230 MtS by 2100 in the high growth cases, and of around 80-90 and 60 MtS in the two low scenarios (IS92c and IS92d) by 2050 and 2100 The IS92 scenario evaluation (Alcamo et , 1995:281-282) concluded that the IS92 scenario series only partially reflect recent legislation to reduce sulfur emissions ( the amendments to the Clean Air Act in the US or the Second European sulfur protocol). Hence, particularly regional sulfur emissions in OECD countries projected in IS92 are much higher than more recent scenarios taking account these legislative changes (as also discussed by IPCC, 1995:155-156). For instance the recent scenarios of the Commission of the European Communities (EC, 1996) indicate that sulfur emissions by 2020 will be between 64 to 77 percent below 1990 emissions levels, or between less than 2 to 3 MtS, compared to 8 in For comparison, the IS92 scenarios project for OECD Europe (including Canada) sulfur emissions between (IS92a and IS92b) and (all other scenarios) MtS by 2020, between 2 to 30 percent lower than in 1990 (12 MtS). In addition, integrated assessment models are increasingly able to model in greater detail driving forces of sulfur emissions as well as acidification impacts ( discussion below). These model simulations suggest that particularly in Asia acidification impacts would require substantial sulfur emission control measures already much earlier than The resulting global sulfur emissions are substantially lower than suggested in the IS92 series: typically in the range between 20 to 80 MtS by 2050 and between 20 to 120 MtS by (A comparison of global sulfur emissions scenarios with and without specific sulfur control assumptions in enclosed as ) What's New since IS92 (scientific front) The importance of aerosols including those from sulfur emissions is by now widely recognized and considerable progress has been made to quantify their effect on regional climate, both in large GCM simulations as well as in more simplified integrated assessment models, MAGICC's SCENGEN module (needs checking for details with Mike Hulme) or Michael Schlesinger's work within the EMF (current status: uncertain). The importance of sulfur emissions as input to climate models is therefore larger than As a result of a major World Bank study on acid rain in Asia also improved national and regional sulfur emissions inventories have become available (Foell et , 1995). Improved emissions inventories outside North America, Europe (including the European part of the former USSR), and Asia (excluding Oceania, for which only sparse data seems to be available) have not been made available since publication of As a result, models and scenarios continue to rely on estimates, largely based on approximate mass and sulfur balance approaches in the world regions for the Middle East, Southern Africa, and Latin America ( discussion of data availability below). Similarly, acidification impact models are increasingly being refined for regions outside OECD in particular for Acidification impact studies for unabated sulfur emissions of coal intensive ``business as usual'' scenarios indicate exceedance of critical loads of up to a factor 10 already within the next three to four decades (Amann et , 1995) with enormous impacts on natural ecosystems as well as important foodcrops (Fischer et , 1996). Increasingly also energy sector and integrated assessment models link regional acidification models with simplified climate models enabling joint analysis of sulfur and climate policies and Examples include the IMAGE model (Posch et , 1996) and the IIASA integrated assessment model (Rogner and Nakicenovic, 1996) that are linked with the acidification model RAINS for Europe and Asia, the AIM (Morita et , 1994) model for Asia, or ???? for North These models extend earlier energy sector models that dealt with a comparative costs assessment of isolated sulfur and carbon reductions, and joint mitigation respectively, such as the OECD GREEN model (Complainville and Martins, 1994). The state of knowledge of joint benefits of sulfur and carbon emission reductions was reviewed in the 1995 IPCC WG III report (IPCC, 1996: 215-218) and is expanding Data requirements The most obvious data requirements concern of course comprehensiveness of sulfur emissions by major source category (anthropogenic and natural, energy sector and other industrial sources). Here the data model of the IS92 scenarios appears appropriate and would only require a reassessment in view of most recent data concerning regional emissions (particularly in China, where data uncertainties seem largest). A more difficult question concerns spatial Independent from the question of which formal models are being used to check for scenario consistency, the outmost spatial detail currently in driving force models with global coverage available is at the level of world regions (typically around 10, but going up to around 20 world regions). Both climate as well as acidification models require inputs at finer spatial It is unclear at present what would constitute a ``minimum'' or ``desirable'' level of spatial disaggregation for the variety of user communities of new IPCC Existing model links (like with the RAINS model) could be used in some regions like Europe and Asia to generate spatially highly disaggregated sulfur emission and deposition maps as inputs for climate models and for impact assessment studies ( for agricultural crop yield models). In their most advanced versions the model links even incorporate regionalized differential growth trends and thus improve on the standard practice of renormalizing base year spatial emission and deposition patterns linearly with a particular sulfur emissions For regions where similar links are unavailable, more simplified procedures will need to be devised, keeping in mind the overall tight time frame of the scenario Two data sets (are there more??) appear available for regionalized sulfur emission patterns: the Oak Ridge GAIA data set (spatial resolution: ????) and the Spiro et (1992) data set (spatial resolution: one degree by one degree). An open (but extremely critical) issue remaining to be resolved is to identify mechanisms and responsible groups that could provide the link between the spatial resolution of the new IPCC scenarios sulfur emissions to whatever final geographical scales required by impact assessment and climate Scenarios and Sulfur Policies There are two major sets of driving force variable that influence future sulfur Level and structure of energy supply and end use, and degree of sulfur control policies (Because of the dominance of energy related sulfur emissions, they should receive particular attention in the new Industrial sources could be included in the scenarios with much a simpler driving force model, coupling to industrial ) Ceteris paribus, highest sulfur emissions occur in scenarios of high demand growth, rapid resource depletion, limited technological change and absence of sulfur control policies outside OECD In terms of energy supply structures such scenarios imply a massive use of coal, including synfuel Typical examples would include the IS92e and IS92f Up to 2050 sulfur emissions in such scenarios roughly grow in line with fossil fuel use and resulting carbon emissions, a roughly constant sulfur to carbon emissions Post 2050, still in absence of sulfur control policies, growth rates of sulfur emissions start to fall short of growth in fossil fuel use due to the internal technology logic of synfuel production: synfuel production requires prior coal conversion ( gasification) and removal of sulfur prior to further conversion, to Ceteris paribus, therefore sulfur emissions relative to those of carbon Sulfur emissions are lower in scenarios with lower demand, more ample resource availability (especially for natural gas), higher rates of technological change (especially for non-fossil energy technologies), and extent and timing of direct sulfur control policies especially outside OECD countries (itself function of projected impacts like acidification), and finally, level of other environmental control measures and valuation of environmental goods ( sulfur emissions are also lower in scenarios imposing limits on GHG emissions). Next to environmental impacts and policies, there are also other key relationships that need to be considered for the formulation of future sulfur For instance, the literature on environmental Kuznets curves ( World Bank, 1992, or IIASA-WEC, 1995) argues that with increasing affluence and valuation of environmental goods, sulfur emissions This hypothesis is corroborated by both longitudinal and cross-sectional empirical Thus, in the process of industrialization and economic development, emissions rise initially, pass through a maximum (say at income levels around 2000 $/capita) and decline thereafter with rising per capita incomes and the resulting preference of cleaner end-use fuels, valuation of clean environments, A scenario taxonomy along the dimensions of demand, resource availability, and technological change in any case is necessary to respond to the critique on the IS92 series that these important driving forces were not varied appropriately to reflect both uncertainty as well as new scientific knowledge and empirical They form part of the overall scenario design process and the scenario ``storylines'' and need not to be addressed specifically in the work on sulfur Separate ``sulfur stories'' could be developed in addition, based on various relationships between sulfur emissions and levels of affluence, industrial structure, within the overall framework of the scenario ``storylines''. Here sulfur emissions would be part of other environmental policies ( on water quality, urban traffic related pollutants, ) that form integral part of particular scenario ``storylines''. A key variable remains the timing and extent of sulfur control policies to be assumed for the new First of all the scenarios need to reflect changes in actual policies As noted above, IS92 did not take full account of recent environmental legislation in both North America and the second European sulfur Secondly, the sulfur policies to be assumed, need to reflect recent scientific findings, in particular the very large local and regional impacts on agricultural crops and ecosystems of unabated high sulfur emission scenarios, particularly in Therefore, all scenarios should assume faster and deeper reductions in sulfur emissions outside OECD countries than were assumed for IS92 in light of this recent scientific The exact timing and extent of such sulfur reduction measures could then be scenario Also no specific reference to individual policy measures would need to be made (to avoid normative policy elements, or recommendations, in the scenarios), as reduction profiles could be adopted from existing sulfur reduction scenarios in the scientific literaursement by UE (Action COST) for the lecturer, but for this I hope to",0

"Trump hammering out party fundraising agreement By Kenneth Vogel, Eli Stokols and Alex Isenstadt 05/09/2016 05:26 PM EDT Donald Trump's campaign is hashing out the details of an agreement with Republican Party leaders that could allow the presumptive GOP presidential nominee to raise six-figure checks for his presidential campaign, multiple sources with direct knowledge of the negotiations tell The fundraising agreement was among the subjects discussed at a Monday meeting at the Republican National Committee's Washington offices between top RNC officials, including chairman Reince Priebus, and senior Trump aides, including campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, senior adviser Paul Manafort and political director Rick Wiley, according to the The talks represent the first formal steps towards a merger between the official apparatus of the Republican Party and a candidate who many party leaders scorned until recently, and about whom there remains deep leeriness in some Republican Since Trump essentially clinched the GOP nomination with a win in last week's Indiana primary, his staff has moved quickly to put their stamp on the party's general election planning Wiley has paid several visits to the party's headquarters on Capitol Hill to assess its efforts, according to the The campaign also has been discussing convention-related issues with the RNC, including credentials and rules, the sources And deputy campaign manager Michael Glassner this week is set to lead a delegation to the convention site, Cleveland's Quicken Loans Arena, to receive a briefing from RNC officials involved in planning for the July event, as POLITICO first reported last Fundraising was not a major focus of Monday's meetings, according to RNC senior strategist Sean ""It was 3 Â½ hours on briefings from all the RNC divisions regarding the capabilities and resources that we have been compiling to win in November,"" said Spicer, who attended the The conversations are also partly an effort to lay the groundwork for a Thursday meeting in Washington between Trump, Priebus and House Speaker Paul Ryan, who announced last Thursday that he is withholding his endorsement until Trump outlines a stronger commitment to conservative The perception among Trump's inner circle is that Ryan is attempting to leverage his position as chairman of the Cleveland convention into securing a deal that protects the party's control over vendor contracts and how the money raised jointly by the party and Trump's campaign is ""Trump is a tough negotiator, understands the history of what he's entitled to here,"" another Trump confidant ""They want the RNC to be autonomous but they'll work with the Trump They need Trump to help raise the money but they want their vendors to be the ones to spend the "" But Trump may be more reliant on the national party than past presidential nominees, since his campaign has invested relatively little in field staff, voter data or a fundraising Some of Trump's infrastructure deficiencies can be traced to his unwillingness to dig deep into his own fortune to finance his campaign, which he has pledged from the beginning to Entering into a joint fundraising agreement and leaning on the party for cash and staff would help fill that void, but also could undermine his rhetoric about being independent from the party's donor To view online: To change your alert settings, please go to or email was sent to user@domain by: POLITICO, LLC 1000 Wilson Arlington, VA, 22209, USA To unsubscribe,",0

"Hi Ed, Just to reiterate one more key point---Superimposing the two series and their uncertainties is not the whole story (although it is a definite improvement over just showing the two reconstructions on top of each other w/ know assessment of uncertainty). However, doing the above still only poses the question: apple +/- [uncertainty in apple] ? orange +/- [uncertainty in orange] As we discussed in a previous email exchange (based on the correlations you calculated between instrumental series w/ the trend removed) , the two reconstructions should probably only share about 60% or so variance in common in the best case scenario, where there is no uncertainty at all, owing simply to the differing target So we need to be very careful w/ the following statement which you made in your previous email: ""If so, this would not mean that the series are not significantly different from each One can't dismiss the highly systematic differences at multi-centennial timescales quite so "" I'm not sure you can justify that statement based on sound statistical reasoning! I agree w/ your following statement ""Why these differences are there is the crux "" However,I hope the discussion will accurately reflect the fact that the leading hypotheses to be rejected in answering that question are 1) random uncertainty in the two series owing to differing data quality and sampling, can explain the difference and 2) systematic differences owing to differing target region and seasonality can explain any residual differences after (1). That may be a tough standard to beat, but it is the approach that Tom, Phil, Keith, and I have all been taking in addressing the issue of whether our different reconstructions are or are not inconsistent and the conclusion has in general been (see IPCC which was really a consensus of many of us, though admittedly only I was a lead author) that, despite notable differences in the low-frequency variability, the different reconstructions probably cannot be considered inconsistent given the uncertainties and differences in seasonality/spatial I have a hard time understanding why the same standard should not be applied to comparisons w/ your current reconstruction? Does your RCS reconstruction really not fall in the mix of all the other reconstructions? Is it truly an outlier w/ respect to Phil's, Tom's, MBH, and other existing hem reconstructions that are based on different seasonality and regional sampling??? We've probably had enough discussion now on this point, so I'll leave it to you to discuss the results in the way you see most fit, but I really hope you take the above points into account, in fairness to the previous I look forward to seeing the final manuscript in one form or another, in any case, cheers, mike",0

This was about a paper in E&E, which when we eventually got it several days later was I found out later that the authors were in contact with the reviewers up to a week before the article So there is peer review and peer review !! Here the peer review was done by like-minded Anyway, I'm straying from the Tim Osborn, Keith Briffa and I felt we should put something on our web site about the paper and directs people to Mike's site and also to E&E and the MM's MM have hounded us about this for the last four In the MM article, they have a diagram which says 'corrected version' when comparing with We have seen people refer to this paper (MM) as an alternative reconstruction - yet when we said this is our paragraph MM claim they are not putting forward a new reconstruction but criticizing MBH 1998 !! We have decided to remove the sentence on our web page just to stop these But if a corrected version isn't a new or alternative reconstruction I don't know what So, in conclusion, I would side with Mike in this In trying to be scrupulously fair, Steve, you've opened up a whole can of If you do decide to put the Mann response into CC then I suspect you will need an MM will want to respond I know you've had open and frank exchanges in CC before, but your email clearly shows that you think this is in a different MM and E&E didn't give Mann the chance to respond when they put their paper in, but this is a too It needs to be pointed out in an editorial though - I'm not offering by the I could go on and on Cheers Phil",0

" PRIMARY DAY TALKING POINTS Topline Message: Today as millions of Americans in five states go to the polls, Democrats are voting with enthusiasm for the candidate they like most -- Republicans are holding their noses and casting their votes for the candidate they dislike We expect that today we'll see the same thing we've seen throughout this campaign, our voters are energized with the serious and substantive primary we've had and two candidates who both have the judgment and temperament to serve; while Republican voters will continue to be dismayed with the chaos on their In the last primary in New York, exit polls showed that nearly 7 out of every 10 Democratic voters believe that our primary has energized our That's because our two candidates have consistently offered strong, well thought-out visions for our country that would move America That's consistent with Wisconsin where 7 out of 10 Democrats in those exit polls said they were excited or optimistic about both of our That's something we're not seeing on the Republican side where serious questions have been raised about their understanding of the issues, not to mention their judgment and temperament given how ugly, divisive and insulting they've Their own voters know Just 39% of Republicans in New York thought their campaign has energized their In Wisconsin 4 out of 10 Republican primary me say that primary voters said they fear what a Trump presidency would do to our And roughly a third would rather stay home, vote for a third party, or vote for a Democrat than support either Trump or That's stunning, but it tells you that Democrats are heading into November in a far stronger position than Talking Points Chaos in Cleveland vs Our Next President in Philadelphia We're less than 100 days from the July conventions, and it's clear that Democrats will emerge united, while Republicans are embroiled in drama better suited for a reality show than a contest for the Both Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders are dedicated to supporting the eventual Democratic Just yesterday, Senator Sanders said at a town hall on MSNBC that he will do everything in his power to make sure no Republican gets into the White House in And Secretary Clinton has been clear about her commitment to unifying the party and the need to build on the progress we've made under Democratic leadership over the last 7 Because the Party's platform is a statement of our values, the domain is committed to an open, inclusive and representative Both of our campaigns will be represented on the Platform Drafting Committee, and just as we did in 2008 and 2012, the public will have opportunities to Democrats know that we're stronger when more voices are heard, and when we stand together to move our country forward, we'll see that in Philadelphia at our We'll see our next President on our stage at the Democratic convention in Compare that to the This week, the increasingly desperate Cruz and Kasich campaigns forged an unusual alliance to stop Trump, but it barely lasted as long as the announcement that it was One-third of Trump supporters said they would abandon the Republican Party if he loses the nomination and runs as a third-party Even Republican leaders are afraid of going near their radioactive You've already seen Republican candidates in tight races, like Senator Kirk in Illinois and John McCain - the GOP nominee eight years ago - say they will not attend their own convention in But don't let them fool you, they're not any better than the top of their Joint Fundraising Committees We welcome any effort by our candidates to help raise money for the domain and state parties, which is why we stood up similar agreements for joint victory funds with both the Clinton campaign and the Sanders campaign early in the The domain is the only entity that will be able to closely coordinate with our eventual nominee, and we took these important steps because of the urgency to build a strong national infrastructure NOW that will help elect Democrats up and down the ballot in It's important to note, the funds that the domain and state parties get through the joint victory funds help strengthen, for example, our national voter file and communications, research and digital support for state parties and down ballot That includes training across a variety of areas, for example, and access to media monitoring and rapid response This is helping us build infrastructure for the general These arrangements are not new or Similar joint fundraising committees were established with our Democratic candidate in both 2008 and And again, both campaigns have signed on and have the option of using joint victory And let's be clear, neither the domain nor state parties are subsidizing fundraising through these committees for either For whatever each campaign raises under the agreement that then goes to their campaign, that campaign pays a directly proportional amount for the cost of that United Convention / Arizona Lawsuit We're going to be united at our convention, and we're confident in our process, which was in place well before we knew who would run this cycle and which has been fair to all of our We've cautioned our candidates to maintain a tone that helps us build toward the general election, recognizing that as we funnel down the home stretch of any campaign the intensity level will Ultimately, Secretary Clinton and Senator Sanders are drawing sharp differences with one another, but their differences remain focused on how to best move America o They're focused on how to make sure our government reflects the values of the American people, that we have an economy and a democracy that are inclusive, and that we respect everyone in If you want to talk about a rigged process, let's focus on the real problem we're seeing across the The Democratic National Committee and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee are suing officials in Arizona whose decisions led to voters having to wait for hours to vote during their March primaries, and many to be disenfranchised as a We want to make sure that doesn't happen in If you want to talk about rigging elections, that's the real example, and it's a serious problem and we're glad both our candidates have expressed interest addressing attempts to make it harder for the American people to In Maricopa County, officials reduced the number of polling locations to just 1 for every 21,000 That's seven times what it was in other parts of the state, and it shows you the magnitude of the efforts to make it harder to vote that Republicans are championing all across the And it's not just Arizona, you had a member of Congress from Wisconsin, Glenn Grothman, who flat out said that they expected they could now win Wisconsin because of the Voter ID It was his Kevin McCarthy moment, and the type of rigging of the system we're not going to put up When voters go to the polls in November, they can be certain that the Democratic nominee will have the temperament and judgment to serve as commander in chief, and that's not something you can say about the Republican GOP Frontrunner Trump is Reckless and Dangerous The Economy: Trump's unfounded predictions of recession and warnings against investing in the stock market are reckless, and economists have already predicted his policies could start an international trade war and cause a global Foreign Policy: Trump's threat to pull back from our most important military alliances in NATO sends a dangerous message, which is particularly troubling in light of his past praise of Russian President Vladimir Nuclear Proliferation: Trump has refused to say he wouldn't use nuclear weapons on European territory, then suggested South Korea and Japan should either develop nuclear weapons or pay the United States for protection against North On abortion: Trump has taken multiple positions on abortion - from a dangerous and offensive call to punish women who get an abortion, to saying he would allow states to restrict women's rights, to saying abortion laws are set but he would eliminate them with judicial Cruz The vast majority of his Republican colleagues can barely muster a straight face to say anything nice or positive about him! Lindsey Graham crassly talked about how no one in the Senate would object if he was killed on the Senate floor, and said that endorsing him over Trump was the equivalent of choosing to get poisoned over being Senator Jim Risch of Idaho - TWICE - gave one of the most passive, non-endorsement endorsements I've ever It's going to be very difficult for Senators and Congress members to run alongside a presidential nominee they really don't like! The GOP's Problem with Women Voters Trump is viewed unfavorably by 7 out of 10 women, but both of his primary opponents would also alienate women voters with their policies as the Kasich said that he wants to see Roe Wade repealed , and when asked what kind of punishment that would lead to, he evaded the question by saying that it should be left to the Cruz said that even if a woman has been brutally raped, she should be forced to carry the pregnancy caused by her attacker to In the past, the Republican candidates have opposed equal pay, family leave, and voted against the Violence Against Women Earlier this month we marked Equal Pay Day, the day in 2016 when women's earnings have caught up with men's earnings from On average we earn 79 cents to their dollar, and it's worse for women of All of the Republican presidential candidates would stand against protections that ensure greater equality in the John Kasich has consistently belittled women and said that we don't need workplace protections, just a 'change of heart' among major Ted Cruz voted against the Paycheck Fairness Act three times and ridiculed the legislation as a 'show ' Donald Trump stated that women would have pay equity if we did 'as good a job' as Republicans to Blame for Trump and His Down Ballot Impact It's fitting that Donald Trump is the standard-bearer of a party that has relied on divisive politics and scapegoating for electoral gain for so Since 2004 they've used gay marriage as a wedge issue, demonized immigrants and stoked fears about border They've given birthers like Trump a pass, and fueled the Tea Party with lies about a total government takeover of healthcare and the Then while in office, the only thing Republicans have done in Washington over the last seven years is Trump IS the Republican Advantage, Democrats Despite all the media attention that Republican frontrunner Trump gets with his say-anything strategy, Democrats are winning where it Senator Clinton has earned more than 10 million votes - Over a million more than Donald Trump - while Senator Sanders has earned more than 8 million votes (well ahead of Ted Cruz and John Kasich), while also garnering more than seven million individual campaign contributions from low dollar If there is an enthusiasm gap, it clearly favors Overall fundraising shows a Democratic edge, with Democrats raising a total of $ million in February and million in March, eclipsing Republicans' fundraising, which amounted to less than $12 million for Cruz, $6 million for Trump, and just $ million for Kasich in And while Trump continues to claim that he is self-funding his campaign, his latest report with the FEC shows that he has loaned his campaign $24 million throughout this election cycle, while he raising just $34 million from outside contributors and loans for the entire Democrats will have the strongest candidate in And we are poised to take back the Senate and make serious gains in the Broad Contrast and Infrastructure We have been building an infrastructure and operation that will work regardless of who the Republicans We see the numbers of course; it's clear Trump is far ahead of his competitors, and we're ready for him if he makes it through what is shaping up to be a train wreck of a But we don't think taking on Trump is fundamentally different from any of the At least with Trump, he's not shy about exposing what the Republican brand has truly Ted Cruz and John Kasich are every bit as extreme as their party's front-runner, they just hide it a bit They promise the same extreme agenda on women's rights, they deny the threat of climate change, and they oppose fixing a broken immigration system with a path to They all want to drag America back to the failed economic policies of the last Republican president who left office losing 800,000 jobs a month and having plunged our country into the Great And they've all been just as offensive in their rhetoric, using language that alienates our allies, helps ISIS recruit terrorists, and makes America less So if it is Trump, we're Maybe it's Cruz, but it's hard to see how that comes together in the But regardless we're building a ground game and an infrastructure that's ready to challenge him on every single position he's taking on the campaign trail, and that holds him accountable for what those positions would actually mean for the American [SigDems] Luis Miranda, Communications Director Democratic National Committee 202-863-8148 - user@domain - @MiraLuisDC ",0

"Hi Caspar, Thanks for the Frankly, Von storch is being duplicitous He may tell certain audiences (like the NCAR group last month) that he is not suggesting that the GKSS simulation is reealistic, because he knows he'll get skewered if he claims But then he turns around to the press, and talks about how the Moberg et al reconstruction matches their model, I frankly consider this dishonest, at best! If what Stefan says is true (that the entire long-term trend, including the cold LIA in the model, is all due to the spinup problem), then it completely invalidates the use of that model for testing statistical reconstruction methodologies which require physically-consistent patterns of variance in the calibration period to reconstruct the But that's a separate As we now know, the far more damning fact is that Von Storch et al knowingly applied a procedure which is not the MBH98 procedure, and they think they can get away w/ admitting this now in some obscure Italian journal which isn't even in the ISI Tim/Phil/Keith: you may not know about the latter, but Caspar should be able to fill you in on this Meanwhile, lets enjoy the media fiesta on Mike",0

The order also cites separate references in 1987 and 19 88 in which unnamed assistant coaches witnessed inappropriate contact betwe en Sandusky and unidentified children, and a 1988 case that was

holding out, Ryan -- the target of pleas to put his own name i n presidential contention (no dice, he says) -- gave down-ballot Republican s cover to separate themselves from the business mogul if it benefits But it was yet another extraordinary moment in what has been a wildly unpr edictable Philip Rucker, Paul Kane and Robert Costa have the story: CWhile acknowledging that Trump has mobiliz ed a powerful grass-roots movement and earned the nomination, Ryan said tha t Trump has not shown himself to be a standard-bearer who bears ou r standard and he put the onus on the business mogul to recalibrate his campaign and offer a more inclusive D Asked by CNN s Jake Tapper whether he backs Trump, Ryan said CI m just not ready to do that at this I m not there r ight D (In response, Trump said he is Cnot ready to sup port Speaker Ryan s agenda D) Ryan s comments deepened the divide in a party now facing a painful reckoning about Trump: His remarks broke a previous pledge to support the

"Hi Peck et A little late but I'd like to put in my twopence worth regarding your original message and Phil's I have been tied up with a load of stuff so don't interpret my lack of speedy response as a lack of interest in these My first comment is that I agree with all of your general remarks and with your implied rebuke to Phil that we should be very wary of seeming to dam certain proxies and over hype others when we all know that there are real strengths and weaknesses associted with them The truth is that all of this group are well aware of this and of the associated fact that even within each of these sub-disciplines Dendro, coral there is a large range of value , or concern with the external usage of our However, my own and Phil's concerns are motivated ,like yourself, by the outside world's inability to appreciate these points and the danger that we will all be seen as uncritical or niave about the real value of proxy The rationale for the recent Jones et al paper, and some things that I have written in the past is to inform would be users , particularly the modellers, that there are critical questions to be addressed about how the palaeo-data are best used in a 'detection' or 'model validation' Many in the palaeo-community understand these issues , but perhaps there has been some reluctance to air them in sufficient depth or in the right situations where they will be heard/seen by those people who now seek to use the data . I believe that many of the modellers , having been blissfully unaware for years of the need to work with the palaeo-community, are now expecting too much . This carries the danger of a backlash as they undertake simple assessments of the palaeo-series and conclude that they are all of very little The problem is that as we try to inform them we may get the balance between valueable self criticism and scientific flagellation The more so when the whip is seemingly aimed at others! There is no doubt though, that many palaeo- types are not concerned with the 'bigger issues' of climate change , so it is up to those who do ,such as this group, to try to sort out some sensible approach to how we do explore the good and bad ,fairly, in our collective data and how we present this to the outside The meeting you propose is a good way he is already not included, I also urge you to invite Ed I hate cold feet and I don't ski so I vote for anywhere away from To answer the question about the degradation in tree-ring chronology confidence back in time - yes, we ( that is several of us in tree rings , and rising out of them, in average temperature or rainfall series, have suggested a basis for quantifying chronology error as a function of series replication and time-dependent chages in the correlations of the series that go to form the mean The problem is tricky because the error is timescale ( frequency) dependent This is just the Calculating confidence limits on reconstructions derived from one or more chronologies must take account of the regression error (again likely to be timescale dependent) while incorporating the additional uncertainty associated with the When the reconstructions are derived using a spatial transfer function ( such as in canonical correlation or our similar Orthogonal Spatial Regression technique )the reconstruction at each point in the predictand network has some ,different, uncertainty relating to the error in each predictor series and the magnitude of its influence in the specific regression equation relating to that Finally, as regards this issue, if you have detrended or high-pass filtered the original predictor series in some way ( tree-ring standardisation) , you have some potential long-timescale uncertainty around the final reconstruction which can not be represented by any analyses of the remaining prdictors or their association with a relatively short instrumental predictand I have a half drafted paper on this which I intended to submit to Tree-Ring Bulletin - perhaps one day! Your question about Jasper, the sample depth, in my opinion , IS responsible for the early high So don't put much faith in the early We have devised a simple method of scaling down the variance in average series to take account of the inflated variance that occurs when a reduced number of series are averaged - such as at the start of this chronology . We used this in our recent Nature paper looking at a possible volcanic signal in the density data averaged over the northern Ed has incorporated this in the latest version of his super tree-ring standardisation/chronolgy construction program , but it was not used in the Jasper work . I agree that we must be careful not to appear to be knocking other proxies- even if this is not intended . We must also be explicit about where problems lie and in suggesting the ways to overcome I for one do not think the world revolves only around The only sensible way forward is through interpretation of multiple proxies and we need much more work comparing and reconciling the different evidence they Let's have more balance in the literature and more constructive dialogue /debate between Keith",0

"Tom, Agreed that NCDC must have some data gaps - but this isn't very clear from the web GISS is inferior - not just because it doesn't use back They also impose some urbanization adjustment which is based on population/night lights which I don't think is very Their gridding also smooths things Plotting all three together for land only though they look similar at decadal GISS does have less year-to-year variability - when I last I assume NCDC should add the back data in - although there isn't the need if infilling is going on I've never looked to see if NCDC changes from year to I think you can say that GISS is inferior to In Ch 3 of AR4 I put the station number counts GISS and NCDC have more, but almost all of this is more data in the Their non-use of a base period (GISS using something very odd and NCDC first differences) means they can use very short series that we can't (as they don't have base periods) but with short series it is impossible to assess for So some of their extra series may be very short ones as As you know the more important thing is where the stations are (and in time).

"David - sounds So, the bottom line is that a little disagreement is ok - that's a reflection of the real uncertainty? But, the discrepancy is not all that big in the end? No need to take this to a higher level? Keith Briffa is back on line and finishing off Section , so you might want to send him an email w/ suggestions that help keep chap 6 compatible w/ 2 and 9 - for example, with respect to solar, we acknowledge the forcing could be less than W/m 2, and the uncertaintly wrt to trop aerosols and land albedo is significant - we could easily be closer to chap 9's Would you say the key is that our analysis acknowledge the uncertainty so as to overlap well with the other chapters? Keith - please make sure you send your new to David too - while you were out, he was working hard w/ chap 2 and 9 to make sure we (the IPCC) avoid saying things that The comparison of radiative forcings from 3 different angles is what assessment is all about, and it's great David has had the patience to help figure it all Thx, Peck Hi Gabi, The key to your proposed solution is the updated numbers from Chapter If indeed the radiative forcing change to 1750 is , then presumably you have made this consistent with the earlier part of Chapter The numbers previously looked like this (I haven't seen the latest version of , but I've included the previous estimates we had in the ZOD): W/m 2 Chapter 6 Chapter 9 MM 1750 Greenhouse gases: TROP aerosols: Solar Volcanic: ? ? Land albedo: + Trop O3: Strat O3: + 1'st indirect aerosol forcing STRAT H2O AVIATION TOTAL There is essentially no change in greenhouse gas forcing from 1750 to 1700 (see for example Crowley et , GRL, 2003), so the difference in the estimated numbers is probably due to inclusion of more things or different choices in Chapter A similar statement holds for trop One can also use these two to presume that the same also holds true for land [The value listed for that in Chapter 9 is quite small compared to some other studies; , Govindasamy et , GRL, 28, 291-294, ] So, to the extent these numbers are still discussed in Chapter 6, they should be made consistent with those in chapters 2 and With respect to your proposed paragraph below: I would drop the comments about trace gas differences but saying land albedo changes may have been greater, along with the additional solar change, could give us the W/m 2 Concerning the temperature response: the Moberg et al paper itself claims 1C difference between 1500 and 2000, but the figure seems to show a larger number, perhaps (again, just eye-balling it). However, the coldest time period is not in the MM but before I think therefore a better estimate from that paper for the MM would be So, with respect to the sensitivity: if W/m 2 is unresolved, then we have a total forcing of ~ W/m 2, and a climate response varying between and 1C - or a climate sensitivity for 2xCO2 of to , or pretty similar to standard IPCC I think this will work!

"Leaving aside for the moment the resolution issue, the statement should at least be consistent with our 6-10 looks like there were years around 1000 AD that could have been just as warm - if one wants to make this statement, one needs to expand the vertical scale in 6-10 to show that the current warm period is 'warmer'. Now getting back to the resolution issue: given what we know about the ability to reconstruct global or NH temperatures in the past - could we really in good conscience say we have the precision from tree rings and the very sparse other data to make any definitive statement of this nature (let alone accuracy)? While I appreciate the cleverness of the second sentence, the problem is everybody will recognize that we are 'being clever' - at what point does one come out looking aggressively defensive? I agree that leaving the first sentence as the only sentence suggests that one is somehow doubting the significance of the recent warm years, which is probably not something we want to What I would suggest is to forget about making 'one year' assessments; what 6-10 shows is that the recent warm period is highly anomalous with respect to the record of the last 1000 That would be what I think we can safely conclude the last 1000 years really tells David",0

Again, I'm motivated by our team agreement - I do think we could delete this phrase since it's more repetitive than new meaning, but would rather not unless it really does not Personally, I like it as modified above, because it hammers the important point from a slightly different perspective - one that seems to be on the minds of the public Thanks, both, for letting me know what you think best, peck Hi Peck and Eystein In response to Points 4-6 Add the following after past 1300 on line 13 page Y-33 ""Considering the recent instrumental and longer proxy evidence together, it is very likely that average Northern Hemisphere temperatures during the second half of the 20th century were warmer than any other 50-year period in the last 500 "" Do not put anything in Box which is written frolm the reverse perspective - evidence of medieval period not good enough to say warmer than Also confuses statements about 500 years and longer (1000 year ) Medieval , The person who says this has not read the text - see lines 28-33 on Y-32 where I think this is well If you read the text on lines 1-10 of PAGE Y-38 I think this meaning is clearly It is not in the same words -but easily supports the ES HOWEVER, I do not like the last part of the statement (and not sure where this came from) because it is ambiguous and anyway implied by prior I strongly urge you to remove the section ""and it is very unlikely that this warming was merely a recovery from the pre-20th century cold "" These would sort things out I believe cheers Keith",0

Jones et al) supposedly represent annual and summer seasons respectively, and both contain large proportions of tree-ring The latest tree-ring density curve ( our data that have been processed to retain low frequency information) shows more similarity to the other two series- as do a number of other lower resolution data ( Bradley et al, Peck et al ., and new Crowley series - see our recent Science piece) whether this represents 'TRUTH' however is a difficult I know Mike thinks his series is the 'best' and he might be right - but he may also be too dismissive of other data and possibly over confident in his (or should I say his use of other's). After all, the early ( pre-instrumental) data are much less reliable as indicators of global temperature than is apparent in modern calibrations that include them and when we don't know the precise role of particular proxies in the earlier portions of reconstruction it remains problematic to assign genuine confidence limits at multidecadal and longer I still contend that multiple regression against the recent very trendy global mean series is potentially You could calibrate the proxies to any number of seasons , regardless of their true optimum response . Not for a moment am I saying that the tree-ring , or any other proxy data, are better than Mike's series - indeed I am saying that the various reconstructions are not independent but that they likely contribute more information about reality together than they do I do believe , that it should not be taken as read that Mike's series (or Jone's et for that matter) is THE CORRECT I prefer a Figure that shows a multitude of reconstructions ( similar to that in my Science piece). Incidently, arguing that any particular series is probably better on the basis of what we now about glaciers or solar output is flaky Glacier mass balance is driven by the difference mainly in winter accumulation and summer ablation , filtered in a complex non-linear way to give variously lagged tongue advance/retreat .Simple inference on the precidence of modern day snout positions does not translate easily into absolute (or relative) temperature levels now or in the Similarly, I don't see that we are able to substantiate the veracity of different temperature reconstructions through reference to Solar forcing theories without making assumptions on the effectiveness of (seasonally specific ) long-term insolation changes in different parts of the globe and the contribution of solar forcing to the observed 20th century warming . There is still a potential problem with non-linear responses in the very recent period of some biological proxies ( or perhaps a fertilisation through high CO2 or nitrate input) . I know there is pressure to present a nice tidy story as regards 'apparent unprecedented warming in a thousand years or more in the proxy data' but in reality the situation is not quite so We don't have a lot of proxies that come right up to date and those that do (at least a significant number of tree proxies ) some unexpected changes in response that do not match the recent I do not think it wise that this issue be ignored in the For the record, I do believe that the proxy data do show unusually warm conditions in recent I am not sure that this unusual warming is so clear in the summer responsive I believe that the recent warmth was probably matched about 1000 years I do not believe that global mean annual temperatures have simply cooled progressively over thousands of years as Mike appears to and I contend that that there is strong evidence for major changes in climate over the Holocene (not Milankovich) that require explanation and that could represent part of the current or future background variability of our I think the Venice meeting will be a good place to air these Finally I appologise for this rather self-indulgent ramble, but I thought I may as well voice these points to you . I too would be happy to go through the recent draft of the chapter when it becomes cheers to all Keith",0

"Dear chapter 6 friends, I have a request on In the interest of a good and constructive working atmosphere, I would suggest that all of us focus on sober scientific arguments and refrain from unneccessarily derogatory comments about the work of I'm referring in this case to David's comment - this reference is overused, especially for such a simplistic model The reference concerned is our theory of DO events which appeared in Nature in 2001 and has since been cited 133 times according to the Web of Science (a sign of overuse?) The model concerned is the CLIMBER-2 model, featured in over 50 peer-reviewed publications since 1998, including 7 in Nature and This model is different from David's model, because it has been constructed for a differenet purpose, but it is not ""simplistic"". It would never occur to me to call David's model ""simplistic"" because it does not include an interactive continental ice sheet model, vegetation model, carbon cycle model, sediment model and isotope I'm absolutely open to any rational scientific criticism and discussion, but I can see no purpose in derogatory statements like the above, which include not even a trace of scientific This kind of thing only poisons the working atmosphere in our group, which I thought was very positive and a great pleasure in Regards, Stefan",0

"Peck and Eystein in case you tried (!), my phone has been broken for the last few days (yes - honestly). I am sorry I had to rush off - and stay longer than I had anticipated . The funeral was delayed while a post-mortem examination had to be held to establish the precise cause of Ironic that dad had struggled on having had at least 3 heart attacks, 2 strokes, chronic diabetes and partial liver and kidney failure for some years (besides being virtually immobile and completely blind for 18 months). All in all , though it was a release, the actual demise was sudden and unexpected and I managed to arrive too late to be with him at the Given the time constraint , this ""final"" revision is not as considered as it might have been , but we have tried to take into account all comments available , and have given considerable attention to the IPCC terminology and emphasis on the bullet points . At this stage , however, there are some clear areas where future work will be required to keep abreast of recent developments and , perhaps, to re-balance the emphasis and I apologise for not having responded directly to Fortunat, Stefan, , David and Tom, but please be aware that I have considered all of their comments and done what I could to address them .Thanks Fortunat and Ricardo (and Ed - who should be added to the list of CAs) for the text and Figures and Henry and Jason for the help and data . David's suggestions about re-ordering the paragraphs was particularly difficult to resolve in my own mind , because I do see the logic , but equally , did not want to interfere with the time line approach to describing post- TAR work that underlies the current as you can see I decided to leave the order as it It would be great if David and Fortunat could check cross Chapter referencing (eg in relation to forcings and detection chapters).

"Dear All, I just wanted to keep you informed about the status of our draft JGR First, thanks to all of you for your comments - they were very I am now in the process of revising the paper, and hope to have a new draft ready by After several discussions with Tom, I have decided to repeat the volcano/ENSO signal separation for the observed data and for the GSOP The reason for this is that there was a conceptual flaw in what I had done The flaw related to the determination of the ""pre-eruption"" reference temperature, used as a baseline for estimating the maximum volcanically-induced Let's call this baseline temperature ""TBASE"". Previously, I was estimating TBASE for Pinatubo and El Chichon from either the raw or Gauss-filtered temperature data at time t (the eruption month). If I was calculating TBASE from the filtered data, the estimate of TBASE was biased by ""contamination"" from post-eruption In other words, since I was using a 13-term Gaussian filter, temperature values from t + 6 months were influencing TBASE, likely leading to an underestimate of the true TBASE I've now modified the program so that TBASE is not computed from the filtered data; instead, it is an average of the temperature anomalies in the MREF months prior to the There is some sensitivity to the choice of MREF (I've been experiment with values ranging from 6-18 months), which again underscores the uncertainties inherent in separating ENSO and volcanic The maximum volcanically-induced cooling is still estimated using filtered data, but now I'm using a 5-term binomial filter rather than the 13-term These changes require repeating most of the analyses in the Preliminary results indicate that the revised estimation of TBASE increases the ratio of the Chichon/Pinatubo maximum coolings, and brings this closer to the ratio of the Chichon/Pinatubo radiative Tom has also made a number of useful suggestions regarding reorganization and shortening of various sections of the Hopefully the next iteration will be a little shorter than the current version of the paper! I will be out of my office next week, but should be back by October With best regards, and thanks again for all your help, Ben",0

" In the interest of time, I took a very quick look through the Here are my thoughts: I think the format would work better if this was in the form of an agreement rather than a letter It is generally how the Company would memorialize something like this, it is more in line with their format and it would solve the issue I have with 1 where we are not agreeing to anything despite how it is Is it necessary for each of the organization entities to be parties? Does it include any entity that is not currently a party to an agreement with Mark E? Do we really want to define each company individually as organization lets please think it through and make sure that the individually and collectively is in our best I understand why it would make the drafting easier but would hate for separate entities to pick up obligations of another simply b/c they are defined a certain Please double check that it works or change In 2 think it would be better to make clear that he isnt giving up anything $ I think the language in the agreement is clear but since we know that is the biggest hurdle to overcome in our draft theirs maybe a more finessed approach would Perhaps ending the first sentence after the word Effective Date and moving the proviso up to the beginning of a new sentence In 2 d and 2 e we should specify under what agmts the $ is I assume Bob is comfortable and Steve has approved giving on the point/agreeing that he gets paid if we havent done a long form by I am not suggesting it isnt fine, just want to make sure since I dont recall it every coming up before they dropped it into their In par 4 think we should be clear about logistics we cant put ourselves in position of being in breach if he doesnt designate These payments go way out way in Perhaps saying that it goes into same account unless he has designated a different one, which he can do at any time or from time to time In par 4 a, b, c - Take out the words as the same may be amended or extended Be more specific about the use of the term therein as those terms are defined in par",0
"Paul and Nick at this point it would be unwise to consider the proposal Yes it has received mixed receptions in different quarters but this was always to be Each of the boards has its own family to protect , or at least this is the way science funding is now perceived, so that the only consideration in the discussion ( especially of proposals from alien boards) is whether or not there will be enough on the carcass for ones The strength of our proposal lies in the potential for true cross-Board participation and the real scientific and strategic advantage of the focus on the Hadley Centre In my mind the problem has always been to get real enthusiasm from ASTB , and if COAPPEC had not been on the table this may have been more I can not see that we could have done anything more in the cicumstances to overcome this hurdle than by enlisting Hadley Centre The decision to go jointly only with ESTB and ASTB was already The issue of 'no money anyway ' typifies the unsatisfactory nature of the system - but in this case I hear things may not be so Apparently some millions more pounds are now available than was the case earlier!

"Hi all, Two things: Concerning the 1470k pacing of There are revisions underway in the layer-counting of the Greenland Ice A meeting in Copenhagen in August co-ordinated by Sigfus Johnsen will discuss the issue at length, but there may not be many papers out from the meeting that are citeable for There is already the Shackleton paper which indicate that Greenland Ice Cores in MIS3 have an age model that are off by some millennia, and the preliminary data on the new age models indicate substantial revisions as far as I hear from talks given at various My thinking is that we neither can ignore the fact that current data indicate a 1470 pacing for some time interval of the ice cores if one apply the existing age I think it would be foolish not not refer to it, I think the possibility that the system has the ability to enter into specific cycles is intriguing, and is a result that is well known and IPCC should not pretend we havent heard about But we should make it less blunt than in the current version of the Abrupt Change subchapter, perhaps stating that the result is highly dependant on age models and we need time to absorb new research in order to verify the Having the fortune of not being that close to the darker sides of US politics, I have the feeling that Pecks comment concerning referencing perhaps is a bit too ""paranoic"". I think the advice is well taken not to overcite our own research, and make sure not to overlook other important contributions, but we should do our best to cite what we think are key In any case we will have the FOD review and have the opportunity to have all our good colleagues keeping us honest on this Cheers, Eystein",0

"Hi Henry - thanks for the Just earlier today, Eystein and I were soliciting approval from our team on how to best get feedback from chapter authors - Lead Authors and Contributing Authors Since we're all authors, it isn't appropriate to comment officially as expert reviewers, but rather to work as a team to take expert reviews - AND chapter 6 author feedback - and use them to create a better finalo One key, as promised earlier, is to have a process that makes sure we get all comments and are able to respond to The other key is that we ensure time to allow the needed Eystein and I are going to ask LAs (including Keith) to do there work sooner in the draft cycle than before so that we have the time for I would suggest you keep these comments in a safe place for a bit longer, and then send them in to the Eystein and I when we ask (should be in the next week). Note that the current draft has only officially been available for a bit over a week (indeed, I didn't see it until today since the IPCC TSU had to check for all sorts of things after we submitted it over a month ago), and we won't be working on the new draft until So we have time to be thoughtful and complete in the feedback gathering Is this ok? Seems more suitable than giving review via the gov process on your own work (you are an author of our chapter). Also, I can anticipate one thing that is going to come up again, and that I don't think we had your feedback on (nor Keith's). What about the borehole recons that you and colleagues have done extending back beyond the last couple I don't have my paper pdf collection here, but I believe you have some recons going back many Does this need more attention in the chapter? Thanks for being proactive and quick to send We'll be sending our email to all CA's soon, if you're willing to wait a couple more Thanks, peck",0

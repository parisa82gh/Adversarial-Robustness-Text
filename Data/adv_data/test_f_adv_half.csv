"Hi Simon, Philip, Eduardo & Gerd (cc Keith), I thought you might be interested in a brief report back from the recent Wengen meeting, specifically about how SO&P-funded work on pseudo-proxies was covered and related hockey-stick Please don't circulate this further, because it is just my personal viewpoint Thanks for letting me show some of your I skipped over some graphs I took from Philip's regression presentation at the SO&P meeting because Francis Zwiers covered forward/inverse/total least squares before I did show some results from Eduardo, including pseudo-proxy results from And I showed a figure from Gerd's ""many flavours"" pseudo-proxy The meeting included fairly intensive discussions about many issues, and this included some discussion of von Storch et (2004, 2006), Wahl et (2006), Mann et (2005), Burger and Cubasch (2005) and Burger et (2006). Generally the discussion was quite open, with only a few disdainful remarks made about the work of people not there -- certainly not enough to distract from useful In general, most people accepted that the MBH method could, in some situations, result in biased reconstructions with too little I'm not sure how much Mike Mann accepted this, but it was reinforced by findings shown by Eugene Wahl that indicated some bias in their CSM pseudo-proxy studies, and particularly by Francis Zwiers who looked to have almost completely replicated the von Storch et results with respect to the MBH method (though he emphasised the preliminary nature of his work and he may not have implemented the MBH method we'll have to wait and see). Mike showed many detailed psuedo-proxy tests of the RegEM method and these seemed quite convincing in showing little problem with that it does assume equal error in both instrumental and proxies, so it should show less bias than other methods that wrongly put all the error in the instrumental record ( , ""typical"" regression). there was some confusion about how the MBH method can be biased but the RegEM not be biased (in pseudo-proxy tests) yet they give the same results for the real Mike thought it might be the ECHO-G vs CSM differences, but I argued against this and was supported by Caspar Ammann and Eugene Wahl who did not think that the character of the model runs was a big factor in explaining different There was limited discussion of trend/detrend and white/red noise pseudo-proxy Many seemed to think that if pseudo-proxy studies showed that detrending definitely caused a problem, then this was a reason not to The alternative of finding a method that worked with detrended data was not really The discussion was fairly constructive and for the most part Eugene Wahl in particular seemed keen to ""build bridges"" within the I should also mention two of the workshop The first is that a paper is being planned based on the things discussed at the workshop and covering many issues from proxy data, forcings, model simulations and I hope that the authorship of this might be wider than just the participants of the workshop, but we will have to wait and see who else is asked to The second is that we should set up a ""climate reconstruction challenge"". The idea would be to use a simulation ( not of the last 1000 years, so none of us know the expected answer) and provide some data from a ""calibration period"" and some ""pseudo-proxies"" from the full period and make these public so that anyone could attempt to make a reconstruction using their favoured method(s). The true model NH temperature series would be kept secret for 6 months or Thus it would be a ""blind"" test and after attempts had been submitted they would be evaluated against the true result to assess which methods were most Caspar Ammann will probably provide the simulation, so he wouldn't take part in making any He would keep the details secret from all others so that any one, including MBH, you and us, could enter the Finally, it was asked whether the model runs that have so far been used for pseudo-proxy studies (NCAR CSM, ECHO-G Erik-I, HadCM3, maybe ECHO-G Erik-II?) might be made publicly available for shared use, so results are less model This would just be the surface air temperature fields from the runs, not all the other What do you think, Simon and Eduardo? If you are happy with this then they could get them from the SO&P website, so no need for data extraction on your Hope you find this summary It's just my I've cc'd this to Keith in case he wants to say anything different! Cheers Tim",0

If you look at the few remaining contests on the Democratic primary calendar, the major news outlets - barring something devastating happening to the Clinton campaign in the next few weeks - are likely to declare Clinton the nominee on June More specifically, New Jersey will likely push Clinton across the finish line, and she may clinch the nomination even before the polls close in If major news outlets declare Clinton the nominee on June 7, they will be counting superdelegates, as they did in 2008 when they declared Barack Obama the presumptive Democratic nominee on June Now, you might ask ""why include superdelegates?"" It's a fair question; superdelegates can change their minds, after For that reason, we haven't included them in our delegate tracker - there was a chance that superdelegates backing Clinton might switch sides, particularly if Sanders was able to win a majority of elected Does Clinton need superdelegates in 2016 more than Obama did in 2008? Hillary Clinton will almost certainly clinch the Democratic nomination with the aid of superdelegates -- and it is not uncommon for a Democratic candidate to do so in a competitive late season Barack Obama also needed a boost from superdelegates in 2008, though Clinton is relying slightly more on superdelegates than Obama Who are the superdelegates? Since 1984, the Democratic Party has set aside seats at its convention for party leaders including Democratic members of Congress, governors, past presidents and members of the Democratic National Committee, giving these leaders a role in choosing the These delegates are commonly referred to as Superdelegates, or unpledged delegates, serve by virtue of their party position or elected They are not bound by state primaries and caucuses and can back any candidate they prefer at the They can also change their minds at any Superdelegates make up about 15 percent of the total number of Democratic delegates and 30 percent of the number needed to With email probe nearing end, FBI may question Hillary Clinton I agents probing whether Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server imperiled government secrets appear close to completing their work, a process experts say will probably culminate in a sit-down with the former secretary of The FBI has already spoken with Huma Abedin, a Clinton confidant who was among the Democratic presidential front-runner's closest aides at the State Former chief of staff Cheryl Mills is also cooperating with the investigation, according to her Bernie Sanders Will Bernie Sanders Hurt His Own Cause? Bernie Sanders's beliefs have been obvious from the He thinks wealthy elites exert too much influence over American He wants the government to lessen income He believes climate change is a pressing threat to the The clarity and overarching ambition of his agenda has been central to his appeal and expectations-defying political success so If Sanders wants his political revolution to last, he will need to win widespread support for his ideas well into the Yet as the primary election draws to a close, the campaign has increasingly made arguments that may undercut the long-term viability of the movement that has coalesced around the Vermont Democratic Party Gives Bernie Sanders Bigger Role In Shaping Its Platform In a move meant to cool down tensions between his campaign and the Democratic establishment, the Democratic Party will give Bernie Sanders ( ) a greater role to play in establishing its platform at this summer's Democratic National Under an agreement the party reached with Sanders and opponent Hillary Clinton, Sanders can select five people to serve on the party's platform committee, a third of the committee's Clinton will name six members, and Debbie Wasserman Schultz ( ), the party chair, will name four, according to the Washington Unity Won't Come Easily for Democrats It looks like Bernie Sanders's political agitation is paying The Democratic National Convention Committee announced the 15 members of its platform drafting committee on Monday, a selection designed to give the Vermont senator an unusual amount of influence on the As The Washington Post reported, ""party leaders hope [the move] will soothe a bitter split with backers of the long-shot challenger to Hillary "" Sanders has been allowed to name five members to the committee charged with writing the party platform, while Clinton named The tally reflects the fact that Clinton leads Sanders in the popular vote for the presidential primary election, but nevertheless grants Sanders allies a significant amount of Bernie Sanders' Campaign Drops Tommy Chong as Intro Speaker Hours Before Rally Tommy Chong is in disbelief after he was disinvited by the Bernie Sanders campaign from introducing the presidential hopeful hours before a rally in East Los The iconic comic actor and outspoken marijuana advocate tells The Hollywood Reporter that the Sanders campaign was happy to have his endorsement months back, but when it came time for the two men to appear in public together, someone got ""cold feet,"" he ""It's lip service to get the votes, but they don't want to endorse what I stand for and what I've stood for all my professional career,"" Chong said right after he was uninvited to the ""It was an "" In an email to THR, a Sanders spokesman said, ""We appreciate his support but a scheduling issue came "" Chong, who was invited on Sunday to Sanders' noon rally in Lincoln Park, says he is sure the campaign put distance between himself and Sanders over the marijuana issue, calling the move a ""weakness"" by the Sanders' He joked that his hair and makeup were done for Republican Party Candidates Donald Trump How Much Can Donald Trump Raise? Donald Trump is holding his first campaign fundraiser Tuesday in the very-difficult-to-spell Albuquerque, as he sets about trying to meet his self-proclaimed goal of raising $1 billion for his presidential election-a long way from his days proclaiming to self-fund his To date, Trump has spent more than $40 million of his own cash on his campaign in the form of loans, but has assured donors he won't use their cash to repay But while Trump is throwing around the huge number, senior aides are cautioning his that it's an unrealistic total, requiring the candidate to raise an average of roughly $6 million every day through November A more reasonable goal, they say, is between $400m-$ While some donors are still firmly in the #NeverTrump camp, Trump's challenge won't be from opponents, but from the absence of an organized financial Donald Trump's Steadfast Commitment to Climate-Change Denial Just Got a Bit More Baffling Noam Chomsky, the celebrated linguist and left-wing political theorist, was recently asked to contemplate the consequences of a Trump ""Well, first we have to ask if he means what he's saying,"" the elderly intellectual ""If he does the human species is in very deep "" Chomsky paused, and his audience had a moment to wonder which Trump gaffe had so galled the patron saint of the American left: Was it his plan to ""take out"" terrorists' families? Or the full-throated defense of military torture? The Donald's praise for punching protesters? Or that loose talk about using nukes? As it happened, the MIT professor wasn't primarily concerned by all the utterances that make Trump a unique figure in American politics; rather, he was most troubled by a statement that makes him all too Donald Trump Wants To Build Another Wall But Never Talks About Here's As a presidential candidate, Donald Trump has taken a pretty hard line on climate He has said that he is ""not a great believer in man-made climate change,"" has called it a ""total, very expensive hoax,"" and has blamed the Chinese for creating the concept ""to make manufacturing "" He has also threatened to renegotiate the Paris climate deal, largely seen as the world's best chance of avoiding the worst impacts of climate As a businessman, however, Trump seems to take a different approach to climate change, privately preparing to protect his investments against climate-related problems like sea level rise and coastal According to permit applications reviewed by Politico, Trump has applied to build a wall to prevent coastal erosion at his Trump International Golf Links seaside golf resort in Ireland - and has explicitly cited risks posed by climate change in his Donald Trump has done the unthinkable: Unite Silicon Valley In a place normally preoccupied with drafting code and dazzling investors, suddenly everyone in Silicon Valley has an opinion about the presidential And it tends to be the same The innovation economy has a serious distaste for Donald The masters of this world complain that his ignorance about their work and its relationship to the global economy is Rank-and-file programmers are quick to call him a clown, or The unity is notable in an environment where groupthink is frowned upon and nobody ever seems to color inside ideological Donald Trump rages on Twitter after veterans donations are called into question Donald Trump took to Twitter on Monday night to defend his donations to veterans' charities amid new questions about his January The questions center on Trump's claims that he donated $1 million to the fundraiser he held instead of attending a Republican debate in At the event, he also named other large donations he reportedly solicited for veterans' But reporters have had a hard time confirming how much money has actually been distributed to veterans' Washington Post reporter David Fahrenthold noted Monday on Twitter that he's ""still looking for the $1M that @realdonaldtrump says he gave vets"" since V/r, Elias Gonzalez | Political Staff Assistant | Veterans Outreach Desk Democratic National Committee O: | C: [footer-d (2)]",0

John is incapable of recognizing and admitting that Douglass et used a flawed statistical test to reach incorrect He continues to misrepresent the analyses we performed in our response to Douglass et I don't see what useful purpose can be served by trying to engage him in reasonable scientific At the Hawaii IPCC meeting in March, John stood up in front of an audience of IPCC Working Group I Lead Authors and attempted to portray himself as a victim of scientific He claimed that his ""alternative"" views on the nature and causes of climate change were being ignored by the mainstream scientific This claim is The ""mainstream"" scientific community has not ignored the ""alternative"" views of folks like John The sad reality is that we've wasted an inordinate amount of time responding to the flawed science and incorrect claims of John and his I'm hopeful that I won't have to waste much more time on the ""great satellite debate"".

"Hi Stefan and team - David Rind is getting the solar forcing series de jour (latest Lean). I expect Keith back on line soon, and then he can help us figure out what type of simulation(s) we'd like, and what other forcings we ought to My take is that it would be good to use the same forcing used in the runs currently in Fig (or at least the ""best"" of those runs - subjective, I'm sure, and all with the old larger amplitude Lean solar), but with the new reduced amplitude Fig currently has the Bauer et al, 2003 run w/ CLIMBER - is it CLIMBER2? Could/should we just re-run with the new solar in place of the old solar (I don't have the paper here - was the solar used scaled to Lean?). I'll cc this to the entire team, as there might be other ideas on how to do this - I think we would want two simulations over the last 400 One w/ the old Lean solar, one with the If we could use one of the existing plotted runs as the ""old Lean"" run, then we only need one new The idea is to show what difference TAR solar (old Lean) AR4 solar (new Lean) So, lets see what Keith and others say, and then line things up to get the run If we can do it w/ CLIMBER, If we need to involve another EMIC (assuming we're not going to get a AOGCM run done in less than a month), then we need to line that Whatever model we use, it should be one already in use by the AR4, so we don't have to worry about the results being published - just the Make sense?

"Mike, Presumably you've seen all this - the forwarded email from I got this email from McIntyre a few days As far as I'm concerned he has the data - sent ages I'll tell him this, but that's all - no If I can find it, it is likely to be hundreds of lines of uncommented fortran ! I recall the program did a lot more that just average the I know why he can't replicate the results early on - it is because there was a variance correction for fewer See you in Cheers Phil Dear Phil, In keeping with the spirit of your suggestions to look at some of the other multiproxy publications, I've been looking at Jones et al [1998]. The methodology here is obviously more straightforward than However, while I have been able to substantially emulate your calculations, I have been unable to do so The differences are larger in the early Since I have been unable to replicate the results exactly based on available materials, I would appreciate a copy of the actual data set used in Jones et al [1998] as well as the code used in these There is an interesting article on replication by Anderson et , some distinguished economists, here [1] discussing the issue of replication in applied economics and referring favorably to our attempts in respect to Regards, Steve McIntyre X-Mailer: QUALCOMM Windows Eudora Version Date: Tue, 26 Apr 2005 13:28:53 +0100 To: Phil Jones ,""Keith Briffa"" From: Tim Osborn Subject: Fwd: CCNet: DEBUNKING THE ""DANGEROUS CLIMATE CHANGE"" SCARE Keith and Phil, you both feature in the latest issue of CCNet: (4) GLOBAL WARMING AND DATA Steve Verdon, Outside the Beltway, 25 April 2005 [2] A new paper ([3] ) from the Luis Federal Reserve Bank has an interesting paer on how important it is to archive not only the data but the code for empirical While the article looks mainly at economic research there is also a lesson to be drawn from this paper about the current state of research for global warming/climate One of the hallmarks of scientific research is that the results can be Without this, the results shouldn't be considered valid let alone used for making Ideally, investigators should be willing to share their data and programs so as to encourage other investigators to replicate and/or expand on their Such behavior allows science to move forward in a Kuhn-style linear fashion, with each generation seeing further from the shoulders of the previous At a minimum, the results of an endeavor-if it is to be labeled ""scientific""-should be replicable, , another researcher using the same methods should be able to reach the same In the case of applied economics using econometric software, this means that another researcher using the same data and the same computer software should achieve the same However, this is precisely the problem that Steven McIntyre and Ross McKitrick have run into since looking into the methodology used by Mann, Hughes and Bradely (1998) (MBH98), the paper that came up with the famous ""hockey stick"" for temperature For example, this post here shows that McIntyre was prevented from accessing Mann's FTP This is supposedly a public site where interested researchers can download not only the source code, but also the This kind of behavior by Mann is simply unscientific and also rather Why lock out a researcher who is trying to verify your you have something to hide professors Mann, Bradley and Huges? Not only has this been a problem has this been a problem for McIntyre with regards to MBH98, but other studies as This post at Climate Audit shows that this problem is actually quite Crowley and Lowery (2000) After nearly a year and over 25 emails, Crowley said in mid-October that he has misplaced the original data and could only find transformed and smoothed This makes proper data checking impossible, but I'm planning to do what I can with what he Do I need to comment on my attitude to the original data being ""misplaced""? Briffa et (2001) There is no listing of sites in the article or SI (despite JGR policies requiring citations be limited to publicly archived data). Briffa has refused to respond to any requests for None of these guys have the least interest in some one going through their data and seem to hoping that the demands wither I don't see how any policy reliance can be made on this paper with no available Esper et (2002) This paper is usually thought to show much more variation than the hockey Esper has listed the sites used, but most of them are not Esper has not responded to any requests for ' Jones and Mann (2003); Mann and Jones (2004) Phil Jones sent me data for these studies in July 2004, but did not have the weights used in the calculations, which Mann Jones thought that the weights did not matter, but I have found I've tried a few times to get the weights, but so far have been My surmise is that the weighting in these papers is based on correlations to local temperature, as opposed to MBH98-MBH99 where the weightings are based on correlations to the temperature PC1 (but this is just speculation right ) The papers do not describe the methods in sufficient detail to permit Jacoby and d'Arrigo (northern treeline) I've got something quite interesting in progress If you look at the original 1989 paper, you will see that Jacoby ""cherry-picked"" the 10 ""most temperature-sensitive"" sites from 36 I've done simulations to emulate cherry-picking from persistent red noise and consistently get hockey stick shaped series, with the Jacoby northern treeline reconstruction being indistinguishable from simulated hockey The other 26 sites have not been I've written to Climatic Change to get them to intervene in getting the Jacoby has refused to provide the He says that his research is ""mission-oriented"" and, as an ex-marine, he is only interested in a ""few good"" Jacoby has also carried out updated studies on the Gasp series, so essential to I've seen a chronology using the new data, which looks completely different from the old data (which is a hockey stick). I've asked for the new data, but Jacoby-d'Arrigo have refused it saying that the old data is ""better"" for showing temperature Need I comment? I've repeatedly asked for the exact location of the Gasp site for nearly 9 months now (I was going to privately fund a re-sampling program, but Jacoby, Cook and others have refused to disclose the ) Need I comment? Jones et al (1998) Phil Jones stands alone among paleoclimate authors, as a diligent I have data and methods from Jones et al I have a couple of concerns here, which I'm working I remain concerned about the basis of series selection - there is an obvious risk of ""cherrypicking"" data and I'm very unclear what steps, if any, were taken to avoid The results for the middle ages don't look robust to I have particular concerns with Briffa's Polar Urals series, which takes the 11th century results down (Briffa arguing that 1032 was the coldest year of the millennium). It looks to me like the 11th century data for this series does not meet quality control criteria and Briffa was Without this series, Jones et 1998 is high in the 11th Note that none of this actually ""disproves"" the global warming However, it does raise very, very serious questions in my We are talking about enacting policies to curb global warming that could cost not billions, but trillions of Shouldn't we at least be allowed to see the source code, the data and ask for replication at a minimum?

"Dear Mike, Regarding my last mesage, In case you wonder about my background, I have attached a 2-page version of my CV, in rich-text format, file My experience, ranging from laboratory work with CO2 fluxes and marine algae, through to organising events at the UN climate negotiations, combined with a strong mathematical and linguistic background, is a somewhat unusual combination which perhaps makes me more a ""jack of all trades"" than a On the other hand, this has given me an interdisciplinary overview which may be valuable for bridging the gap between science and policy, appreciating dilemmas and uncertainties, and communicating these around the However, Kyoto left me very disillusioned by the apparent lack of connection between climate science and policy -in the protocol there was not one sentence discussing what we need to do to stabilise the climate in the long term, based on scientific This made me wonder, what is the use of my intricate research on air-sea CO2 exchange, if the policymakers ignore even the most basic knowledge? I left UEA and started working at home, developing interactive web graphics showing the link between per-capita emissions and global climate Eventually, I realised that working alone was neither effective nor sustainable, and this has led to unfortunate personal Now I need the stimulus of working again in a team, in an institute, even if this requires sacrificing of my own I am not just looking for a ""job"", it is more important to me, to rejoin the research community, and feel I am making the best use of my I hope you can help, if only to discuss the I have also attached a zip package containing the interactive java applets which I developed, it's only 90K including supporting webpages and historical Once unzipped (all in one directory), you have to open the file "" "" in any java-enabled web I can send a self-extracting windows version if you prefer, on the other hand you may find it easier just to look at the website Currently, this uses only very crude formulae loosely based on IPCC SAR and GCI's C&C, -but the presentation is unique: you can adjust the parameters just by dragging controls with a mouse, and all the linked plots respond It's hard to describe in words, which is why I encourage you to have a Ben Dr Ben Matthews user@domain,",0

"Consulate of Mexico 3552 Dodge , Omaha, NE 68131 To Whom It May Concern The Mexican Government 's involvement in the illegal crossing of immigrants into the United States of America is not only criminal; it shows a lack of ethics in the Government of The Mexican Government has failed to provide basic human rights services to the least of their Many of them feel that they have no other recourse but to flee from the conditions that exist in It can be easy to label the National Socialist Movement as a racist organization targeting poor Hispanics but before you go any further let 's examine what a Hispanic If you were to randomly sample 100 people who claim to be Hispanic you will find that some will be of African descent, some will be of European descent and some will descend from the indigenous natives of Mexico (Aztecs and etc). What the American people perceive as Hispanic is mostly the caste that descends from the Native population of While the highest level government officials descend from the Spanish Conquistadors that came from Europe centuries What many American people fail to realize is that your former President Fox was from the Euro-Spanish caste and your current President Felipe Calder\F3nis also from the Euro-Spanish The Euro-Spanish caste is the most prosperous and educated group of population in Mexico while the Native-Mexican caste represent the most uneducated and impoverished social economic group not only in Mexico, but the whole Your government has failed to provide a basic education, medical care, and opportunities for its It is far easier for the Mexican Government to encourage the Native-Mexican caste to cross the border illegally into America where they can take advantage of the American It is easy to label our tax-paying citizens racist when they stand up and say In America, medical insurance has skyrocketed to absorb the costs of those who have not insurance many of the uninsured are illegal immigrants from Is it fair for our hard working American Citizens to continue to pay for medical care for those who are here illegally and have no intention to pay for services rendered? It is easy to call our retired citizens racist when they stand up and say Programs that our elderly have paid into during their working years are in jeopardy due to thousands of senior Mexican citizens who have crossed the border illegally to receive services that the Mexican government does not It is not only criminal how little the Mexican Government provides their older senior citizens, it 's Many seniors American Citizens are struggling to survive on social security, subsidized utilities, and food stamp These benefits are spread thin enough by our own citizens who have paid for them during their working Unfortunately these same benefits are given to elderly Mexican citizens who illegally cross the border mainly because those benefits do not exist for them in Can you explain why the Mexican government finds it more convenient to encourage their elderly to migrate to America instead of developing effective senior programs to take care of elderly Mexicans? It is easy to call our young working mothers racist if they were to stand up and protest the expense of having a child in These young working citizen-mothers pay into the system for health care When their babies are delivered, our young working mothers must pay, often 20% of the total bill, for the delivery of their Yet thousands of young Mexican women cross the border illegally to have their infants delivered for free in Who pays for this expense? The delivery fees have increased over the past five years and our American Citizens Why isn 't the Mexican government doing more to provide safe, clean hospitals and effective health care programs to take care of safely delivering your future generation? It is easy to call our school children racist when they complain about the lack books, computers and other educational California once was a state that had an exemplary educational Their students scored high on the national standardized tests however the injection of the children from illegal immigrants has slowed the educational Our tax payers must now pay for books printed in both English and Spanish so that the children can be effectively We must pay to teach not only the immigrant children English, we must teach our children Spanish as Many of your Mexican Citizens illegally immigrate for the sole purpose of their children receiving a quality education in Why isn 't the Mexican government providing an effective school system for all Mexican citizens? The reason is clear because the citizens that are crossing the border are the indigenous native-Aztec A caste that is considered undesirable by the descendants of the Euro-Spanish conquistadors who conquered Mexico years ago and still retain power Your former President Fox is as Caucasian and your current President Felipe Calder\F3n are the true racists not the proud American members of the National Socialist Your highest government officials have no desire to help the lower class Aztec-Native citizens and have gone so far as to publish a booklet with comic book style illustrations instructing the Aztec-Native citizens how to safely cross the A Government sanctioned booklet explains in great detail how to safely cross the border, what clothing to bring, what food to pack, and It also explains in great detail how to cross the border Your booklet also instructs those who ""Migrate"" to America what to do if they are detained by the border patrol, or later arrested as an ""illegal alien"". Your booklet lists phone numbers for every Mexican consulate office in America and instructs them to call them if What responsible government would publish a guide how to ""Migrate"" from their sovereign land if they truly valued their native born citizens? The NSM will not deny that we have a desire to see racial reform in our social As nationalists we are proud that our Nation has social programs designed to care for our citizens in Setting race aside, our social programs are designed for our national citizens not for those who illegally come to Our national citizens pay for these programs with their tax money in hopes that if a time of need came, those programs would be there for On September 1st, 2007 the National Socialist Movement will assemble at the Mexican Consulate office in Omaha This is a historic time when the NSM will stand up for ALL American citizens and say While the immigrants who are crossing our borders are here illegally, it 's time to expose the real President Felipe Calder\F3n, former President Fox and the corrupt Mexican Government who refuse to deal with the problems within their own A Mexican Government that dumps their social problems on America 's doorstep instead of dealing with A government who should immediately issue an order to recall all citizens who have migrated illegally to the United A government who should pay for all medical services rendered to their citizens while illegally residing in the United The real criminals are President Felipe Calder\F3n Former President Vicente Fox The NSM would also like the Mexican Consulate to address the following article published in the Hispanic Business magazine and Please explain why your Mexican governors are unwilling to step up to the challenge of developing jobs for their own citizens? Does governor Amalia Garcia Medina realize that her citizens, who are working illegally, may be remitting money to Mexico, but are not paying taxes on their income which in turn pay for social programs that her citizens are actively using while in America?

"Dear Osvaldo and Martin, It is very difficult to make considered input into this process at such short I received the emails Wednesday afternoon, just before being away from the office for 48 I also am not fully aware of the process into which this is fitting and it is the first time I have seen the WGII I do however make some comments on the following: The WGII outline Chapter 2 on data Chapter 13 on critical damage WGII outline ----------------- Key Questions: there is, in analytical terms, very little difference between the 2nd and 4th key question you The impacts under unmitigated CC (Q2) are not in any fundamental way different from the impacts under mitigated CC (Q4). 2degC warming, for example, will give broadly the same impacts whether this occurs because of strong CC policy intervention or whether it occurs because of low carbon development What matters more for impacts is the rate of CC and what matters more for how important those impacts are is the development path I think this distinction between mitigated and unmitigated CC is tenuous and This has a bearing on the later discussions about stabilisation (where ""stabilisation"" is usually assumed to be, indeed often synonymous with, the result of mitigative action; actually (quasi-) stabilisation, at different levels, can occur in a world with relatively little direct CC mitigation policy). The progression through the sections follows a rather linear and reductionist model - observed impacts, future impacts, adaptation, I would have liked to have seen an early opening chapter on the nature of the dynamic relationship between climate and society (before we even start talking about climate change), this being able to bring out notions of vulnerability and adaptation - both fundamental to put on the table before we start thinking about future climate change and how important it This could also point out that ""critical"" damage is already being caused by climate and climate Under your structure, the observed impacts section (II) should surely parallel the later future impacts section (III) in terms of There are only 4 themes in section II, yet 6 (different) themes in section Why for example is nothing said about observed impacts on urban infrastructure or on coasts? The asymmetry between these section sub-themes is itself perhaps It seems odd that adaptation is to be addressed in all the thematic chapters in Section III as well as in a separate later chapter on This situation is ripe for overlap and Our understanding of adaptation in any case should be brought in right at the beginning (see above). The avoiding critical damage chapter suffers from the same problem identified above - what matters is whether and how such exceedance rates can be identified, not whether they result from either a mitigated or an unmitigated scenario - this academic distinction cannot be sustained in the real The regional section is in danger of repeating the mistake in the TAR, again leading to dispersion of effort and My suggestion would be not to assess all new regional knowledge (again; very turgid), but instead to produce a much more streamlined section focusing on a few regional/local case studies that illustrate sharply many of the (integrating) themes introduced earlier - vulnerability, adaptation, criticality, Deliberately seek to be selective and not I also do not see how the WGII chapters will be co-ordinated with the 5 cross-cutting papers identified here - again, there seems much scope for duplicitous effort and redundancy or even And since the cross-cutting papers are really the interesting and useful ones, this suggests to me that the old traditional WG structure of IPCC is now deeply flawed (as I have said more than once before in public). Chapter 2 - Assumptions, --------------------------------------------- First question to raise is what is WGI doing in this regard? I cannot comment sensibly without knowing how WGI will tackle questions of scenarios and future In section , 4th bullet: how relevant really are these ""Stabilisation scenarios (mitigation)""? At the very least IPCC must clear up this issue about whether stabilisation is a short-hand for mitigation (as implied here). This is potentially misleading, since stabilisation can occur in many different worlds, by no means all of them worlds with strong CC mitigation Continuation of this thinking means reality is being forced to accommodate the arbitrary thinking of the UNFCCC rather than UNFCCC being forced to take account of Also in this bullet is ""Impacts of extreme climate events"". Why are impacts being looked at here? Surely this is totally What is important are scenarios - of whatever origin and methodology - that embed within them changes in the character of ""extreme"" weather and how we describe such We should not separate this out as a separate issue Section (the second appearance) confuses Much of this material appears earlier in , thus characterisations of future conditions is what is about and also the projected changes in key drivers is what the scenarios part of is all Do you mean to differentiate between methodology ( ) and outcomes ( )? And as always you will run into the problem of summarising what scenarios actually are assumed in this report - is there to be an IPCC 4AR standard scenario(s) that all should use? I suspect Resolving this problem gets to the heart of the structural problem with Different people will use different Chapter 13 - Critical Damage ------------------------------------------------ This outline was almost unintelligible to me! For example having read the opening aims and scope statement several times, I an still not clear about the approach this chapter is Sections and are also extremely unclear as is section I think someone needs to do some clearer thinking about this chapter before sending it out for people to comment I have my own views on this, but at such short notice and without knowing the agreed IPCC process I'm not going to write the chapter outline for Inter alia, the chapter should address the following: - different paradigms for defining ""critical""; will vary by sector, culture, - distinction between external (pronounced) definitions of critical and internal (experienced/perceived) definitions - relationship between adaptive capacity and ""critical"" rates of change - dependence of critical thresholds on sector and spatial scale - reversibility (or not) of critical damage and if the use of ""critical"" is a euphemism for ""dangerous"" then it is not very subtle - people will see through What is the difference between critical and dangerous?

"Phil, Here are some speculations on correcting SSTs to partly explain the 1940s warming If you look at the attached plot you will see that the land also shows the 1940s blip (as I'm sure you know). So, if we could reduce the ocean blip by, say, degC, then this would be significant for the global mean -- but we'd still have to explain the land I've chosen here This still leaves an ocean blip, and i think one needs to have some form of ocean blip to explain the land blip (via either some common forcing, or ocean forcing land, or vice versa, or all of these). When you look at other blips, the land blips are to 2 times (roughly) the ocean blips -- higher sensitivity plus thermal inertia My adjustment leaves things consistent with this, so you can see where I am coming Removing ENSO does not affect It would be good to remove at least part of the 1940s blip, but we are still left with ""why the blip"". Let me go If you look at NH vs SH and the aerosol effect (qualitatively or with MAGICC) then with a reduced ocean blip we get continuous warming in the SH, and a cooling in the NH -- just as one would expect with mainly NH The other interesting thing is (as Foukal et note -- from MAGICC) that the 1910-40 warming cannot be The Sun can get at most 10% of this with Wang et al solar, less with Foukal So this may well be NADW, as Sarah and I noted in 1987 (and also Schlesinger later). A reduced SST blip in the 1940s makes the 1910-40 warming larger than the SH (which it currently is not) -- but not really So why was the SH so cold around 1910? Another SST problem? (SH/NH data also ) This stuff is in a report I am writing for EPRI, so I'd appreciate any comments you (and Ben) might Attachment Converted: ""c:\eudora\attach\ "" Attachment Converted: ""c:\eudora\attach\ """,0

"Dear Friends, A few remarks before the meeting of tonight and tomorrow, I am sure that our meeting will make clearer the different objectives of ECF, in particular regarding the articulation between the scientific agenda and activities in direction to stakeholders and I would like to stress that I will attend the ECF meeting not only in the name of the Cired, but also in view of preparing the involvment of the Institut Laplace in ECF, namely the community of climate modellers, with which we develop a long term research I would like to explain hereafter in a few words what should be, in my view the priorities of ECF, in terms of scientific agenda: Given recent Ipcc experience, the first priority would be to progress in direction to integrated Indeed the lessons of the Ipcc are twofold: - first the Sress scenarios confirm the possibility of generating very different emissions growth scenarios over the long run, but the consistency between the Storylines and the numerical scenarios remain uncertain; this uncertainty and vagueness reveals a more fundamental limitation of the state of the art of economic modelling over the long run, in particular to provide an explicit picture of linkages between structural changes (infrastructure transportation, urban forms that govern the energy content of final consumption, industrial structure and the so-called dematerialisation), innovation and both macro and micro economic drivers (productivity, growth and price-signals). This makes very difficult to detect where are the real bifurcations, the real policy-parameters and to make much progress in the understanding of the timing of policy responses, - second the sections on 'damages ' have make some progress but remain weak in terms of the social and economic More precisely they deal mostly with impacts on physical parameters (sea-level rise), in a few cases adress impacts on humans (tropical diseases), but all this does not give a comprehensive picture of social and economic damages (once discounted the effect of adapatation), One of the scientific objective of ECF should be to be prepared to provide in a few years for a convincing contribution in future exercises like the SRES and in the future Ipcc This passes first through two parallel efforts: - on long term economic modelling where the limitations of existing tools are obvious depiste real progress; this relates basically to three challenges: - a macroeconomic framework insuring the consistency between prices and quantities at any point in time without necessarily resorting to the modelling tricks relying on the conventional neo-classical growth theory; these 'tricks' assume indeed perfect foresight, efficient markets and the absence of strategic or routine behaviours; New conceptual frameworks about endogenous growth theory allow for such a move, but there is a gap between advances in pure theory and empirical modelling, - the endogeneisation of technical change and more precisely to develop this endogeneisation in such a way that the information coming from sectoral models in energy, transportation or agriculture is not lost (this comes back to the bottom-up/top-down controversy); note that one key challenge here is to progress in direction to transportation and agriculture - an explicit treatment of expectations and uncertainty; one key issue indeed is that the stabilisation of expectations over the long run is the main driver of technical change, consumption patterns and structural - on 'coupling' economic and climate models: here there are two routes, either to develop coupling methods between large-scale models or to develop interface compact modules, reduced forms of large scale Both routes are valid, however, in the following years, to develop integrated models made up with reduced forms of larger models seems more promising; thanks to tractable and numerically controlable models, in will be easier to reveal the key mechanisms at work and to introduce This will pass through progress in the representation of carbon cycle (including sequestration) in such models and, more importantly in the representation of damages and adaptation, which rises rather fundamental conceptual issues that explain what seems to be the second priority in my The second prority relates to the joint question of damages and precautionary principle: - part of the agenda is covered by Mike Hulme's paper and I will not elaborate here on other dimensions I would link to include and how to assess a I will simply insist of the fact that we need to set up a taxonomy of damages in economic terms, this means as resulting not of the climate transformation per se but from the joint effect of inertia and uncertainty (to pass to Riviera to the beaches of Normandy in not a cost in itself in a world restabilized around a new climate equilibrium; what matter are the transition costs and the generated variability of climate). Moreover I would insist for adopting deliberately a worldview because, fundamentally, climate change will generate a new human geography, and not to be restricted to the European subcontinent, - this should lead to develop in parallel stochastic decision modelling tools to disentangle the many dimensions and views about the precautionary principle and, I take some risks in saying that, in a symmetric treatment of climate damages and nuclear risks (we cannot avoid to try and put some rationale in this discussion which is one of the reason for the failure of the EU tax in 1992 and of COP6, and which will be an 'hidden' division line within the EU) The third priority should be the topic 1 made by For me the two first modelling efforts I described briefly are outmostly important to bring new insights for responding the question of the However, we have, before waiting for the acheivement of a new generation of models (which will respond to point 2 and 3 of Klaus's paper), it matters to develop in parallel a specific programm on international coordination architecture given the failure of COP6 and the lack of understanding of economic and social implications of the selection of this architecture (coordination through prices or quantities, full agreement or partial expanding coalition, issue linkages, perceived equity etc ). This workprogramm should build on advances on the role of economic and non economic instruments in fostering innovation, and on the distributive static and dynamic implications of such These are very brief remarks, simply to give you some ideas about my current ",0

"Dear All, Thanks very much for the helpful discussion on these I write to make a point that may not be well recognized regarding the character of the temperature trends in the lowermost stratosphere/upper I have already discussed this with Ben but want to share with others since I believe it is relevant to this controversy at least at some The question I want to raise is not related to the very important dialogue on how to handle the errors and the statistics, but rather how to think about the The attached paper by Forster et appeared recently in It taught me something I didn't realize, namely that ozone losses and accompanying temperature trends at higher altitudes can strongly affect lower altitudes, through the influence of downwelling There is now much evidence that ozone has decreased significantly in the tropics near 70 What we show in the attached paper by Forster et al is that ozone depletion near 70 mbar affects temperatures not only at that level, but also down to lower I think this is bound to be important to the tropical temperature trends at least in the 100-50 mbar height range, possibly lower down as well, depending upon the degree to which there is a 'substratosphere' that is more radiatively influenced than the rest of the Whether it can have an influence as low as 200 mbar - I don't But note that having an influence could mean reducing the warming there, not necessarily flipping it over to a net This 'long-distance' physics, whereby ozone depletion and associated cooling up high can affect the thermal structure lower down, is not a point I had understood despite many years of studying the problem so I thought it worthwhile to point it out to you It has often been said (I probably said it myself five years ago) that ozone losses and associated cooling can't happen or aren't important in this region - but that is Further, the fundamental point made in the paper of Thompson and Solomon a few years back remains worth noting, and is, I believe, now resolved in the more recent Forster et al paper: that the broad structure of the temperature trends, with quite large cooing in the lowermost stratosphere in the tropics, comparable to that seen at higher latitudes, is a feature NOT explained by CO2 cooling, but now can be explained by the observed ozone Exactly how big the tropical cooling is, and exactly how low down it goes, remains open to quantitative question and improvement of radiosonde But I believe the fundamental point we made in 2005 remains true: the temperature trends in the lower stratosphere in the tropics are, even with corrections, quite comparable to that seen at other We can now say it is surely linked to the now-well-observed trends in ozone The new paper further shows that you don't have to have ozone trends at 100 mbar to have a cooling there, due to down-welling longwave, possibly lower down Whether enhanced upwelling is a factor is a central No global general circulation model can possibly be expected to simulate this correctly unless it has interactive ozone, or prescribes an observed tropical ozone The AR4 models did not include this, and any 'discrepancies' are not relevant at all to the issue of the fidelity of those models for global So in closing let me just say that just how low down this effect goes needs more study, but that it does happen and is relevant to the key problem of tropical temperature trends is one that I hope this email has Happy new year, Susan",0

"Dear Mike, Thanks for your detailed reply concerning Scengen and I was not proposing to incorporate Scengen in a major way into the training package, and I am quite aware of the problems of consistency regarding aerosol effects, natural variability, Rather, I thought that the training package would be an excellent way to introduce the existence of Scengen (and MAGICC) to the Country Teams which are responsible for coordinating national (the intention was NOT to provide intensive technical training in its use -- the country team members are largely coordinators, not technical climate experts). In this way, when it comes time to actually carry out the national assessments, Scengen would be recognised as a major tool for scenario generation and, if appropriate, CRU could be contacted regarding its application, technical training or You had mentioned to me at the IPCC meeting in London that one of your major aims was to get Scengen recognised as the ""standard"" for scenario generation for impact assessments, and I simply thought I saw a way of furthering that aim through the CC:Train Given the training programmes that you are currently proposing through ENRICH and others, I can understand your fears that we might ""muddy the waters"".

"Rabbi Feintuch, I recently read an article in the Columbia Tribune where you were quoted as stating ""It's not enough to ignore this anti-event,"" Feintuch ""I don't know that simply doing nothing in the face of the evil message that these neo-Nazis want to bring to our town is the right solution because that leads some people to think that we are "" Feintuch suggested one way to react positively would be for Columbia residents to join the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People or the Anti-Defamation This would be a way to show neo-Nazis that their presence only increases the strength of organizations they oppose, he I did not give your words another thought until I received some letters & e-mails from a few local residents, asking the NSM to challenge you to a public The letters said a number of different things, some of which is best kept to There were some very valid points and I address those herein, along with my challenge to you for an open and public You call the message of a White Civil rights group (The NSM) Evil manifests itself in many ways Rabbi, you believe that a group of Patriotic White men and women standing against Communism and Illegal immigration is I believe that many jews are evil, with the senseless butchering of women and children in Palestine, by Israel, and undermining the United States Government for their own self gain via powerful lobby groups such as AIPAC and other evil I could go on, but I am not writing a Henry Ford of Detroit Auto fame already wrote the book ""The International jew"", and his Patriotism for America was second to The other excellent talking point that was relayed to me about your message was Why is it you are so quick to presume to tell the local citizens that they should join special interest groups such as the NAACP, and the ADL? Is it not hypocritical to speak up against a group that advocates White Rights, yet publically endorse two other special interest minority groups? The winds of change are blowing, and White people are tired of being bullied and having minority special rights shoved down their We Americans believe these are valid points, and I think a Public debate on these issues from both sides would help the community to better understand why certain special interest groups should be held above White groups, furthermore you can explain what is so evil about Patriotic I hereby publically challenge you to a debate! You are so quick to call a group of Patriotic American people How about you face me in a public debate, to allow the public to judge for themselves who is evil, then who is on par with the Founding Father's of this great Nation?

I've just re-read that post, the key paragraph from [1] is as follows: ""The interpretation of this is a little unclear (what exactly does the sigma refer to?), but the most likely interpretation, and the one borne out by looking at their Table IIa, is that sigma is calculated as the standard deviation of the model In that case, the formula given defines the uncertainty on the estimate of the mean - how well we know what the average trend really But it only takes a moment to realise why that is Imagine there were 1000's of simulations drawn from the same distribution, then our estimate of the mean trend would get sharper and sharper as N However, the chances that any one realisation would be within those error bars, would become smaller and Instead, the key standard deviation is simply sigma That defines the likelihood that one realisation ( the real world) is conceivably drawn from the distribution defined by the "" I had therefore expected the test to use the standard deviations of both the models and the observations (which would give a flat plot in 5B and there would be an obvious overlap of the uncertainties in 6a at say 500hPa). best regards Gavin -----Original Message----- From: Ben Santer [[2]mailto:user@domain] Sent: Fri 10/31/2008 4:06 AM To: Cawley Gavin Dr (CMP) Cc: Jones Philip Prof (ENV); Gavin Schmidt; Thorne, Peter; Tom Wigley Subject: Re: Possible error in recent IJC paper Dear Gavin, Thanks very much for your email, and for your interest in our recent paper in the International Journal of Climatology (IJoC). There is no error in equation (12) in our IJoC Let me try to answer the questions that you The first term under the square root in our equation (12) is a standard estimate of the variance of a sample mean - see, , ""Statistical Analysis in Climate Research"", by Francis Zwiers and Hans von Storch, Cambridge organization Press, 1999 (their equation , page 86). The second term under the square root sign is a very different beast - an estimate of the variance of the observed As we point out, our d1 test is very similar to a standard Student's t-test of differences in means (which involves, in its denominator, the square root of two pooled sample variances). In testing the statistical significance of differences between the model average trend and a single observed trend, Douglass et were wrong to use sigma_SE as the sole measure of trend uncertainty in their statistical Their test assumes that the model trend is uncertain, but that the observed trend is The observed trend is not a ""mean"" quantity; it is NOT Douglass et made a demonstrably false Bottom line: sigma_SE is a standard estimate of the uncertainty in a sample mean - which is why we use it to characterize uncertainty in the estimate of the model average trend in equation (12). It is NOT appropriate to use sigma_SE as the basis for a statistical test between two uncertain The uncertainty in the estimates of both modeled AND observed trend needs to be explicitly incorporated in the design of any statistical test seeking to compare modeled and observed Douglass et incorrectly ignored uncertainties in observed I hope this answers your first question, and explains why there is no inconsistency between the formulation of our d1 test in equation (12) and the comments that we made in point #3 [immediately before equation (12)]. As we note in point #3, ""While sigma_SE is an appropriate measure of how well the multi-model mean trend can be estimated from a finite sample of model results, it is not an appropriate measure for deciding whether this trend is consistent with a single observed "" We could perhaps have made point #3 a little clearer by inserting ""imperfectly-known"" before ""observed trend"". I thought, however, that the uncertainty in the estimate of the observed trend was already made very clear in our point #1 (on page 7, bottom of column 2). To answer your second question, d1 gives a reasonably flat line in Figure 5B because the first term under the square root sign in equation (12) (the variance of the model average trend, which has a dependence on N, the number of models used in the test) is roughly a factor of 20 smaller than the second term under the square root sign (the variance of the observed trend, which has no dependence on N). The behaviour of d1 with synthetic data is therefore dominated by the second term under the square root sign - which is why the black lines in Figure 5B are In answer to your third question, our Figure 6A provides only one of the components from the denominator of our d1 test (sigma_SE). Figure 6A does not show the standard errors in the observed trends at discrete pressure Had we attempted to show the observed standard errors at individual pressure levels, we would have produced a very messy Figure, since Figure 6A shows results from 7 different observational We could of course have performed our d1 test at each discrete pressure This would have added another bulky Table to an already lengthy We judged that it was sufficient to perform our d1 test with the synthetic MSU T2 and T2LT temperature trends calculated from the seven radiosonde datasets and the climate model The results of such tests are reported in the final paragraph of Section As we point out, the d1 test ""indicates that the model-average signal trend (for T2LT) is not significantly different (at the 5% level) from the observed signal trends in three of the more recent radiosonde products (RICH, IUK, and RAOBCORE )."" So there is no inconsistency between the formulation of our d1 test in equation (12) and the results displayed in Figure Thanks again for your interest in our paper, and my apologies for the delay in replying to your email - I have been on travel (and out of email contact) for the past 10 With best regards, Ben",0

"Dear Ben and All, After returning to the office earlier in the week after a couple of weeks off during the holidays, I had the best of intentions of responding to some of the earlier Unfortunately it has taken the better part of the week for me to shovel out my avalanche of [This has a lot to do with the remarkable progress that has been made -- kudos to Ben and others who have made this possible]. At this point I'd like to add my 2 cents worth (although with the declining dollar I'm not sure it's worth that much any more) on several issues, some from earlier email and some from the last day or I had given some thought as to where this article might be Although that issue has been settled (IJC) I'd like to add a few related thoughts regarding the focus of the I think Ben has brokered the best possible deal, an expedited paper in IJC, that is not treated as a But I'm a little confused as to whether our paper will be titled ""Comments on by Douglass et "" or whether we have a bit more While I'm not suggesting anything beyond a short paper, it might be possible to ""spin"" this in more general terms as a brief update, while at the same time addressing Douglass et as part of We could begin in the introduction by saying that this general topic has been much studied and debated in the recent past [ NRC (2000), the Science (2005) papers, and CCSP (2006)] but that new developments since these works warrant revisiting the We could consider Douglass et as one of several new We could perhaps title the paper something like ""Revisiting temperature trends in the atmosphere"". The main conclusion will be that, in stark contrast to Douglass et , the new evidence from the last couple of years has strengthened the conclusion of CCSP (2006) that there is no meaningful discrepancy between models and In an earlier email Ben suggested an outline for the paper: 1) Point out flaws in the statistical approach used by Douglass et 2) Show results from significance testing done 3) Show a figure with different estimates of radiosonde temperature trends illustrating the structural 4) Discuss complementary evidence supporting the finding that the tropical lower troposphere has warmed over the satellite I think this is fine but I'd like to suggest a couple of other First, some mention could be made regarding the structural uncertainty in satellite We could have 3a) for sondes and 3b) for satellite The satellite issue could be handled in as briefly as a paragraph, or with a bit more work and discussion a figure or table (with some trends). The main point to get across is that it's not just UAH RSS (with an implied edge to UAH because its trends agree better with sondes) it's actually UAH vs all others (RSS, UMD and Zou et ). There are complications in adding UMD and Zou et to the discussion, but these can be handled either qualitatively or The complication with UMD is that it only exists for T2, which has stratospheric influences (and UMD does not have a corresponding measure for T4 which could be used to remove the stratospheric effects). The complication with Zou et is that the data begin in 1987, rather than 1979 (as for the other satellite products). It would be possible to use the Fu method to remove the stratospheric influences from UMD using T4 measures from either or both UAH and It would be possible to directly compare trends from Zou et with UAH, RSS & UMD for a time period starting in So, in theory we could include some trend estimates from all 4 satellite datasets in apples apples But perhaps this is more work than is warranted for this Then at very least we can mention that in apples apples comparisons made in CCSP (2006) UMD showed more tropospheric warming than both UAH and RSS, and in comparisons made by Zou et their dataset showed more warming than both UAH and Taken together this evidence leaves UAH as the ""outlier"" compared to the other 3 Furthermore, better trend agreement between UAH and some sonde data is not necessarily ""good"" since the sonde data in question are likely to be afflicted with considerable spurious cooling The second item that I'd suggest be added to Ben's earlier outline (perhaps as item 5) is a discussion of the issues that Susan raised in earlier The main point is that there is now some evidence that inadequacies in the AR4 model formulations pertaining to the treatment of stratospheric ozone may contribute to spurious cooling trends in the Regarding Ben's 1 -- this is a very nice graphical presentation of the differences in methodology between the current work and Douglass et However, I would suggest a cautionary statement to the effect that while error bars are useful for illustrative purposes, the use of overlapping error bars is not advocated for testing statistical significance between two variables following Lanzante (2005). Lanzante, , 2005: A cautionary note on the use of error Journal of Climate, 18(17), This is also motivation for application of the two-sample test that Ben has ",0

I have the pdf of the 1986 paper and 38 rejected for urban warming trends (31 in America and 7 in Europe - none elsewhere) out of 239 were rejected for other Brohan et al is the best We included urbanization as one of the biases (one sided as urban should lead to warming, so if you look very, very closely at the error range in the paper you'll see it is slightly I've been giving some talks here and have more At CMA I've found they have a homogenized dataset of 745 stations for the country which they are preapred to give me at some point for They have adjusted for all site moves but not for It seems that it is almost impossible for sites here to be rural (maybe only 1% of the total). Sites move out of the city at regular intervals as the cities So Beijing has 6-7 site moves since 1951! Also China seems to be the only country that doesn't use airport None are located at I'm going to give them my Chinese sites in return so they can do some I'll talk with their person (Mr Li ) more Another interesting bit of work here is that they also have an homogenized set of monthly wind speed data from Not sure how they homogenize this for site moves, but almost all the sites (about 200) show declines in mean wind speeds since NCEP and ERA-40 also show this for wind speeds at 1000, 925 and 850hPa as Odd thing is that they think the decline in wind speeds is due to urbanization! - Li's English isn't great though, so I could be Another person I've been talking to has been looking at precip trends from 1951 - again they think declines in China are due to urbanization! Odd then that there are increases in China, which is also urbanized at similar Air quality here is awful - I saw the sun for the first time since arrival on Sunday, after a long downpour cleared the air this morning!

"HI Tim, Thanks for your Yes, you guys have us beat on the early monday end of things! Your points are all I think we all agree there is much work left to be done, more than enough for all of us to continue to be involved in constructive collaboration, Scott and I, for example, are almost done writing up the work based on your visit w/ us last year, and will send the initial draft on to you, Keith, and the others involved in the near It will be a good chance to try to address a lot of these questions in an article of adequate length to discuss the nuances that unfortunately cannot be addressed in a shorter I also appreciate your more detailed comments about the comparisons, Your points are all reasonable We can maintain an honest difference about how well those points were conveyed in the Science piece (for example, you can imagine how the statement in your piece ""This record has a smaller amplitude of century-to-century variability, and is consistently at or near the upper limit of alternate records produced by other researchers"" might indeed have been interpreted as setting MBH99 apart as, in your words, an ""outlier""). We have good reason to believe that our reconstruction will in fact nderestimate extratropical temperature means but far less so full globe/hemisphere-means prior to the 18th century because the basis functions that primarily set the extratropics apart from the full hemispheric patterns ( , NAO type patterns and other anomaly patterns largely carried by EOFs #2 and #3) start to drop out from our basis set prior to the 18th century, while the pattern that best resolves the full global and/or hemispheric mean (with note from MBH98, particularly large loadings primarily in the tropics and subtropics) still That is why we have never published an extratropical temperature reconstruction prior to the 18th I would be happy to discuss this point with you and Keith and others in more Thus, I have compared Esper et al w/ our records in the manner described in my previous email, which I think allows us to diagnose the extent to which differing high-latitude and full-hemispheric patterns may, at times, explain the somewhat modest differences between the records when similarly scaled to the full hemispheric 1856-1990 mean, and always, within the context of the diagnosed There is no guarentee, as you say, that the uncertainties are correct, but I personally believe they'll stand up over You can call me on this 10 years from now, and somebody will owe somebody a In any case, I hope and fully expect we can all continue to all be engaged in constructive interaction & hopefully continued It will require some sensitivity on all our part to the larger issues surrounding our work, and the way it gets presented to the broader community, but I don't think that should be all that I look forward to these more constructive I'll do my best to foster them, Mike",0

"Excerpts from POLITICO Playbook Breakfast conversation with RNC Chairman Reince Priebus By Mike Allen 05/06/2016 05:38 PM EDT RNC Chairman Reince Priebus was interviewed as part of the Playbook Breakfast series in Washington, , on May MIKE ALLEN: We're going to start with a gift to the guest, which we've never done In your profile with CNN, which was done before Tuesday, they asked you how you were feeling about how the primaries were going, and you said, ""Well, I'm not exactly pouring Baileys in my "" So, thanks to my colleague Daniel Lippman, Kevin Robillard, a little present [a bottle of Baileys] for you, REINCE PRIEBUS: Oh, Now, where's the Lucky Charms and the bowl? MIKE ALLEN: Your job now is to elect Donald Trump president of the United That makes you feel how? REINCE PRIEBUS: We've said all along that whoever our nominee is, we're obviously here to support the I think that we're as prepared as we've ever I tell you what, if we had the RNC of today four years ago, I think Mitt Romney would be We've gone from a committee that was in disarray to a committee that's raised over $75 million more dollars than domain just this cycle, hundreds and thousands of people out in the field, 5,000 people going through 6 weeks of training, and a $100 million makeover in our data So, we're prepared to keep the Senate, keep the House, and win the White And, if you look at Hillary Clinton, look, I would rather take a few elbows being thrown than the director of the FBI interviewing your top aides and potentially the Democrat MIKE ALLEN: Tell us what happened when you decided and you tweeted that Donald Trump was the presumptive REINCE PRIEBUS: I had thought--heard some rumors about the potential of Ted Cruz dropping out in the I didn't go out of my way to confirm any of it or make any phone calls because, you know, sometimes there are times you actually don't want to be in the information loop on things like that; because once you're in the loop, then if something leaks, you're one of the people in the So, I went to the fundraiser and, sure enough, the cell phone starts buzzing--you know, a few buzzes is one thing, but when you get, like, 15 in a row and you don't want to look down at your phone when you're talking to people and you pick it up and you realize, okay, I guess the rumor was Went back to the house in Kenosha, which I hadn't been to in a very long time, which was nice, and that was it, and made some phone Obviously talked to Donald Trump a couple of I think he did a nice job and very gracious in his speech that night, and I think we need, obviously, more of I think being presidential, 30,000 feet, I'm hoping that we're going to see more of MIKE ALLEN: Does ""crooked Hillary"" count as presidential? REINCE PRIEBUS: I think he's done an effective job of labeling, and look, I think she does have a history of being I think that she's got a lot to answer I think that she's got families of dead heroes in Benghazi to answer She's got a tenure as Secretary of State to answer I think she's got a lot of material for us to cling on to and MIKE ALLEN: What's he like behind the scenes? REINCE PRIEBUS: Far more gracious and personable than I think you see at I've never had a problem behind the I've never had a situation where something was said by him that wasn't followed So, all of my interactions have been extremely positive, which made the ""system rigged"" stuff, you know, so out of place for me, compared to what was being said personally behind the REINCE PRIEBUS: I think he's said it himself that there's going to be a time to shift to general election mode, and I think that's the way he sees I think that's the way he feels about it, that now the general election is starting and what you saw on Tuesday night I think is going to be more of what you see in the And really, the person you saw on Tuesday night was the person that I got used to dealing with on the telephone and in So, that general election approach is the type of approach I've been dealing with for six MIKE ALLEN: Is there any way that in Cleveland the rules could be used to nominate someone other than Donald Trump? REINCE PRIEBUS: My personal view is it's highly, highly As I said before, the Rules Committee of 2016 writes the rules for the I don't write the And, in fact, the RNC's role at the convention is fairly limited, and I know we've been through this now for months together, walking through our rules, but the RNC is basically a caretaker, an administrator, of the MIKE ALLEN: So, I hear you saying it's unlikely but not REINCE PRIEBUS: Well, nothing is impossible but it--like I said, I've said this many times, highly--and I add another one--highly MIKE ALLEN: Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska, one of your rising stars, had a Facebook post and tweet storm two nights calling for a draft of an adult conservative challenger to Trump, and he pre-loaded it with hashtags #WeCanDoBetter and Is there any danger of a third party run from the right? REINCE PRIEBUS: I don't believe I think that the amount of time, energy, money, and also it's a guarantee to elect Hillary And I think when people start to take a breath and let some of this stuff calm down, I think that people are going to understand that the Supreme Court is too important to let differences of opinions and choices in our primary to get in the MIKE ALLEN: But the Republicans that I talked to say that there's no way to guarantee what the--Donald Trump will nominate conservatives to the REINCE PRIEBUS: Well, that's why I think that a smart thing for Donald Trump to do would be to release five to ten names of people that he would pool from to say, ""Here's ten folks that I think would make great Supreme Court justices,"" and work with people to come up with that I think things like that would be helpful in kind of recalibrating some people's minds as far as, ""Okay, what is this about why do we need to support the Republican nominee""--which I think we're going to get MIKE ALLEN: Now, after Speaker Ryan made his comment that he was not ready [to support Donald Trump] to Jake Tapper on CNN's The Lead, how quickly did Donald Trump call you? REINCE PRIEBUS: Well, I had talked to him already once that day, but I had talked to Donald Trump and Paul Ryan multiple times yesterday MIKE ALLEN: But Donald Trump called you within minutes? REINCE PRIEBUS: [ ] 're pretty MIKE ALLEN: What was his mood? REINCE PRIEBUS: You know, it wasn't, like, furious or anything, it's just like, ""What do I need to do? I mean, I'm""--and I--so, I said, ""Listen, let me just""--my view is just relax and be gracious and I'll talk to Paul and we'll try to work on I know Paul really well and I know he's being honest, and I know how he And so, I'm comfortable with the idea that it's going to take some time and some cases for people to work through MIKE ALLEN: Joe Scarborough said on Morning Joe yesterday that for him to vote for Donald Trump, Trump would have to change some of his positions or at least some of his emphasis, including the idea of restricting the entry of Muslims or forced Do you sense that with Speaker Ryan, who you're very close to, that it also will take some change in position? REINCE PRIEBUS: First of all, I'm in agreement on the deport--on the ban coming I mean, I put a statement out on that already, that it's not something that I believe in or our party believes I believe our party is the party of the open Our party is the party of opportunity and freedom and equality, and it always will remain So, there are some things I don't agree MIKE ALLEN: Do you hope to persuade Donald Trump that the Republican Party should be the party of the open door? REINCE PRIEBUS: Yeah, and I think he believes am going to work very hard on making sure that some of these issues are discussed and talked about and understood and I'm confident that given my experience so far with him that he's going to have an open mind to some of these MIKE ALLEN: Mitt Romney said last night when he announced that he wouldn't support Donald Trump, he said, ""I see way too much demagoguery and populism on both sides of the "" Do you there's way too much demagoguery and populism?

REINCE PRIEBUS: Something that people don't report on a lot, which is there is an incredible enthusiasm out there in our I mean, we have record turnout: 70 percent higher among Republicans, 30 percent lower among We have an advantage over voter registration in battleground states that we haven't seen in 25 In the first quarter of this year at the RNC we raised more money than ever in any first quarter in the history of the So, we were raising more money in the first quarter than we raised in MIKE ALLEN: What's the biggest thing you learned about the press during the primaries? REINCE PRIEBUS: That there's so much of it and there's so many people, and a lot of talented people online, traditional, that almost nothing breaks So, if you have a really good story that you're really proud of and you think that you've done a great job, it's very difficult for you all to break through, because there's just so I also believe that, in too many cases, it's all about In many cases, I'm not that worried about the I'm worried about the headline, because a lot of times the headline doesn't match the I mean, you take this group of articles about the RNC meeting in April, all of you that wrote articles about how there's going to be a rules fight that think you just owe everyone an apologize, because it's There's no rules fight; it was And so, it's that kind of stuff where you're just, like, bog down organizations with clickbait and people have to answer for things that are MIKE ALLEN: Do you agree with Donald Trump that beating Hillary Clinton will be easy? REINCE PRIEBUS: Well, I didn't know he said I don't think anyone would have predicted that Trump in this fashion would have, you know, taken out 16 other He certainly defied the odds, and I would say that--first of all, I personally don't think it's going to be easy, because I think raising the money, building the ground game, having the data, targeting The truth is, our party is a great midterm party but we've had a real hard time winning presidential elections, and it's nothing the last time we've won with relative ease was And so, I think it's a difficult task but I think we're up to it and I think that we have--we have a big upside, So, I know that there are perils, but I also know that there's an MIKE ALLEN: The night of the Indiana primary, ABC Political Director, Rick Klein, posted analysis headline, ""Donald Trump completes takeover of weary Republican "" Do you agree this is Donald Trump's party? REINCE PRIEBUS: No, it's the party's The party is, was, and will remain the Republican Party of the open door, freedom, opportunity, and equality, and our platform remains--I believe our platform will remain much the same as it is right MIKE ALLEN: Donald Trump repeatedly said, as you mentioned earlier, that the GOP nominating process is I guess it worked out pretty well for him, but as we look ahead do there need to be changes? REINCE PRIEBUS: I have my preferences, but it really doesn't What matters is that the states themselves adopt their own delegate The Rules Committee at the convention will look at all of this and make recommendations as to how to be the changes we made to the rules over the two-year period that we had an opportunity at the RNC were at the were historic I mean, the idea of making states that have caucuses or beauty contests tie the allocation to those contests was a big You saw the Ames Straw Poll is no Why? Well, because candidates were going to Ames, spending tons of money and getting nothing out of it, but they had to And we said, ""If you're going to do these things, you better tie delegates to "" There are things that we need to do to improve the debate 're not going to have a calendar that no one can count on where one week goes by and then you have an ABC debate and then ten days later we're going to be in Myrtle Beach and no one knows what's going We're going to have a set And we're going to have some say on who the moderators I mean, we're not going to have Chris Matthews conducting the Republican Party And now, what's going to happen is four and eight years from the party's going to have even more I'd actually like to see one day, if it's possible, I know there's FEC problems, but for the party to actually own the rights of the nomination One day, that's going to Both parties are going to own the rights and they will--they will have media outlets hook into the--just like the NFL MIKE ALLEN: So, you said it's like the So, you would charge for access to the nominating process? REINCE PRIEBUS: No, just on the I mean, the point is, should media outlets be making tens of millions of dollars on a product that the parties should nomination process, I think, should go to the benefit of both parties, not the benefit of the MIKE ALLEN: In December 2012, you commissioned the Growth and Opportunity Project, which was called an honest review of the 2012 election What is the biggest recommendation of that report that has been achieved? REINCE PRIEBUS: Getting data, buying consumer data, census data, melding it over to voter file, and then putting in an application that's easy for field staff to the other big change is, and it sounds very basic, but it is actually important, is that we're a year-round party, I mean, we used to be a party that would accumulate cash in a bucket and, you know, so you'd have $50 million cash on hand, and then the nominee would walk in in May or June, and you'd say, ""Okay, here's the Now, let's go spend it "" We're spending a ton of money, too, and that's the difference, deciding that we're not going to be a party that shows up three months before What the Democrats do is they actually build their operation around the nominee, around the So, it was Barack Obama that built the $100 million data system in It was Barack Obama that never let the field staff off the ground in Ohio and But what Hillary Clinton has now going is something that she never She didn't want to spend millions of dollars in New York and millions of dollars in Indiana and now millions of dollars in So, instead of worrying about voter registration in Florida, they're worrying about how in the world are we going to put this thing MIKE ALLEN: On Page 4 of the Growth and Opportunity Project, it says, ""Many minorities wrongly think that Republicans do not want them or want them in the "" how do you scale that perception with what Donald Trump has been saying? REINCE PRIEBUS: If you're not there mechanically in the community with people from the community trying to talk about our party, talk about school choice, talk about SBA loans for business owners--if someone's not there, nothing is going to You also need to have the believe obviously you like If people don't think you like them, then they're not going to vote for MIKE ALLEN: Do Hispanics think that Donald Trump likes them? REINCE PRIEBUS: I think there's work to do, and I think that there's work on tone to I've been clear about I think he gets think you're going to see the change in We're in Hispanic and black communities every day, and you saw the numbers in Now, granted, that's a midterm, but Cory Gardner got 46 percent of the Hispanic vote in We spent $7, $8 million on the ground in John Kasich got 28 percent of the black vote in If Romney would have just gotten 10 percent, he would have won So, we're talking about long-term commitment to Hispanic, black communities, Asian communities, every community in between, and a full-time, year-round party that [Trump] understands that it's important for us to do that MIKE ALLEN: You saw yesterday that Donald Trump tweeted a picture of himself digging into a tortilla bowl, a big dollop of sour cream in it- REINCE PRIEBUS: I didn't see it, I heard about So, I had other--you can imagine I had other things to deal with yesterday MIKE ALLEN: Anyway, the tweet says, ""Happy The best taco bowls are made in Trump Tower I love Hispanics!"" REINCE PRIEBUS: He's [ ] Honestly, he's And I tell you what, I honestly think he understands that building and unifying and growing the party is the only way we're going to win, and I think he gets MIKE ALLEN: What are your plans for the convention? REINCE PRIEBUS: There's a lot of things that are already I mean, the stage is There are things that just have to We moved the convention up seven weeks to Certainly, when we were talking about an open convention, it seemed like I was a genius for doing that, but now we just have to get cruising and get I think we've done a great job at the I think that when it comes to a competent, national party, I don't think anyone in this room can say that this national committee isn't the best mechanically rounded, competent committee that we've ever I think having our convention in Cleveland is going to pay off big dividends to winning Ohio, because I think people there, even if they're independent and Democrats, I think they understand what we've done for the city of Cleveland, by going to Cleveland and putting them in the MIKE ALLEN: In an interview with The Washington Post last month, Donald Trump said, ""It's very important to put some showbiz into a convention; otherwise, people are going to fall "" Do you agree the convention should have more of a showbiz feel? REINCE PRIEBUS: I like the idea of having more of a fun convention, if it's showbiz, if it's entertainment, whatever the case may I like that idea, but with every suggestion comes millions of dollars in So, the suggestions are great, but there has to be, you know, a pretty big influx of cash to do something like MIKE ALLEN: Both Presidents Bush, Jeb Bush, Senator John McCain, Illinois Governor Bruce Rauner, Senator Mark Kirk of Illinois, Senator Richard Burr of North Carolina, they all say they're not coming to the Senator Kelly Ayotte in a tough race in New Hampshire says it Do you worry about so many of your key leaders sitting it out? REINCE PRIEBUS: Many of these people didn't come to the last two conventions, and so I think you have to kind of look at it that You have to look at people If they're in-cycle, most of the time, they're not coming to the I mean, just off the top of my head, you asking that, I don't think Claire McCaskill went to the convention that was four years MIKE ALLEN: Democrats are licking their chops about the possibility of a One Republican said to me, ""Donald Trump is either going to win 48 states or lose 44 "" Do you sometimes feel that way? REINCE PRIEBUS: You know, I don' I think this is going to be a really close I think they will I think people are You've seen the last couple of elections have been close, even though the Electoral College looks I think it's going to be tight and we're going to do everything we can to make sure that we I think sometimes in our party we get criticized because we don't hit hard You know, we didn't talk about Bill We didn't talk about some of the things that happened in Barack Obama's life during I don't think Donald Trump is going to have a hard time bringing out some of the things that are going to be very not good for Hillary MIKE ALLEN: What other states could Trump win that Romney didn't? REINCE PRIEBUS: I think he can win I think he can win I think he can win I think he can win I think he could put Michigan and Minnesota in MIKE ALLEN: You were elected RNC Chair in 2011, you were reelected in 2013, reelected Are you going for a four-peat?

This approach seeks to exploit the complimentary information in a diverse network of proxy indicators by determining the most consistent relationships between these networks of data and the leading spatial patterns of climate variability during a recent ""calibration"" period of overlap with the modern instrumental The calibrated relationship is then used to estimate large-scale patterns of climate variability in the past from the proxy This method makes no assumptions regarding the relationship between a given proxy indicator and specific local annual/seasonal climate variable, but does assume that the proxy indicator is tied to some combination of large-scale patterns of climate Alternatively, it is possible to estimate large-scale temperature patterns from a relatively homogenous network of proxy climate indicators ( , tree-ring density data--see Briffa et al, 1998) by invoking a local calibration between each climate indicator and the climate variable ( , summer temperature) of This approach is more conservative in the amount of information it seeks to extract from the proxy data network, but it is free from assumptions regarding the large-scale patterns of past climate Recent reconstructions of Northern Hemisphere annual-mean and warm-season temperature patterns using these respective approaches and data show some similarities, but also some important Here we investigate these differences more closely, examining the sensitivity of Northern Hemisphere temperature pattern reconstructions to (a) the underlying proxy data used, (b) the particular method used to estimate large-scale patterns from these data, and (c) the target seasonality of the By controlling independently for each of these three factors, we gain insight into the reasons for differences between various proxy-based estimates of past large-scale temperature ",0

As to change of base period - this seems like a decision for the whole of To redo the global temperature average, I can just move the series up/down, but this isn't the correct way to do I should talk out a new base period from all the individual stations and recalculate anomalies for the For the oceans this isn't a problem, but the land it is a serious Many stations have good ( near complete base periods for 1961-90) but I'll lose hundreds, maybe over a thousand, stations if I went to For both surface temperature and precipitation we don't have spatially complete datasets (like models) so it will be quite For the circulation indices (like SOI and NAO) based on station pairs there is a variance term (SD). Some of the character of the series will We could easily adjust all these series by simple offsetting but it isn't doing it I'm in the throws of a project with the HC checking all the 61-90 normals we have for series that are incomplete, to ensure we don't have any This has taken quite a time and I don't want to waste the The arguments of Albert and Dave make a lot of sense - continuity with the TAR These sort of things can be explained, but then the FOD will not be compatible with all the papers we are referring This will lead to lots of I would like to stick with I don't want to change this until 1981-2010 is complete, for 3 reasons : 1) We need 30 years and 81-10 will get all the MSU in nicely, and 2) I will be near retirement !! 3) is one of As climatologists we are often changing base periods and have done for I remember getting a number of comments when I changed from 1951-80 to If we go to a more recent one the anomalies will seem less warm - I know this makes no sense scientifically, but it gives the skeptics something to go on about ! If we do the simple way, they will say we aren't doing it Best idea might be to show some maps of 1981-2000 minus 1961-90 to show spatially where it makes a difference for temp and Showing it is quite small and likely within the intermodel differences for years which are only nominally This might keep both sides We also probably need to consider Also the paleo chapter will find 1981-2000 1961-90 is difficult for them but not Cheers Phil PS Fatima has received all the emails - her email only came to Not heard from some of our ",0

Similar to last year: Lawmakers are required to put forward a budget and it's likely be a Democratic plan (surprise!).

"Dear folks, You may be interesting in this snippet of information about Pat Perhaps the organization of Wisconsin ought to open up a public comment period to decide whether Pat Michaels, PhD needs re-assessing? Michaels' PhD was, I believe, supervised by Reid It dealt with statistical (regression-based) modeling of crop-climate In his thesis, Michaels claims that his statistical model showed that weather/climate variations could explain 95% of the inter-annual variability in crop Had this been correct, it would have been a remarkable Certainly, it was at odds with all previous studies of crop-climate relationships, which generally showed that weather/climate could only explain about 50% of inter-annual yield How did result come about? The answer is In Michaels' regressions he included a trend This was at the time a common way to account for the effects of changing technology on It turns out that the trend term accounts for 90% of the variability, so that, in Michaels' regressions, weather/climate explains just 5 of the remaining 10%. In other words, Michaels' claim that weather/climate explains 95% of the variability is completely Apparently, none of Michaels' thesis examiners noticed We are left with wondering whether this was deliberate misrepresentation by Michaels, or whether it was simply As an historical note, I discovered this many years ago when working with Dick Warrick and Tu Qipu on crop-climate We used a spatial regression method, which we developed for the wheat belt of southwestern Western We carried out similar analyses for winter wheat in the USA, but never published the Wigley, and Tu Qipu, 1983: Crop-climate modelling using spatial patterns of yield and climate: Part 1, Background and an example from Journal of Climate and Applied Meteorology 22, There never was a ""Part 2"".

"Dear Phil, Thanks for your I agree that I think these folks just don't quite seem to get it! Anyways, I've pasted in the text of Broecker's piece below (everything there but the Trust me, the figure isn't worth looking at anyways). Will be very interested to hear your thoughts after reading mike PALEOCLIMATE: Was the Medieval Warm Period Global? Wallace Broecker The reconstruction of global temperatures during the last millennium can provide important clues for how climate may change in the A recent, widely cited reconstruction (1) leaves the impression that the 20th century warming was unique during the last It shows no hint of the Medieval Warm Period (from around 800 to 1200 ) during which the Vikings colonized Greenland (2), suggesting that this warm event was regional rather than It also remains unclear why just at the dawn of the Industrial Revolution and before the emission of substantial amounts of anthropogenic greenhouse gases, Earth's temperature began to rise Was it a coincidence? I do not think Rather, I suspect that the post-1860 natural warming was the most recent in a series of similar warmings spaced at roughly 1500-year intervals throughout the present interglacial, the Bond et have argued, on the basis of the ratio of iron-stained to clean grains in ice-rafted debris in North Atlantic sediments, that climatic conditions have oscillated steadily over the past 100,000 years (3), with an average period close to 1500 They also find evidence for the Little Ice Age (from about 1350 to 1860) (3). I agree with the authors that the swing from the Medieval Warm Period to the Little Ice Age was the penultimate of these oscillations and will try to make the case that the Medieval Warm Period was global rather than One difficulty encountered when trying to reconstruct Holocene temperature fluctuations is that they were probably less than In my estimation, at least for time scales greater than a century or two, only two proxies can yield temperatures that are accurate to the reconstruction of temperatures from the elevation of mountain snowlines and borehole Tree ring records are useful for measuring temperature fluctuations over short time periods but cannot pick up long-term trends because there is no way to establish the long-term evolution in ring thickness were temperatures to have remained Corals also are not accurate enough, especially because few records extend back a thousand The accuracy of the temperature estimates based on floral or faunal remains from lake and bog sediments is likely no better than (4) and hence not sufficiently sensitive for Holocene The Mountain Glaciation Record At the Last Glacial Maximum, mountain snowlines throughout the world were on average about 900 m lower than today (5). On the basis of today's rates of temperature change with elevation, this required an air temperature cooling at the elevation of the glacier of about 5C (and a corresponding tropical sea surface temperature cooling of about 3C). During the Younger Dryas--a cold ""spell"" of about 1200 years during the last deglaciation--snowlines in the Swiss and New Zealand Alps dropped to about 300 m below the lowest levels reached in the subsequent Since their 1860 maximum at the end of the Little Ice Age, the retreat of Swiss glaciers represents a rise in snowline of about 90 m (6). If this rise could be attributed entirely to air temperature, the required warming would be between and However, simple considerations suggest that precipitation changes result in a negative feedback of about 20% (7). The warming required to account for the post-1860 retreat of Alpine snowlines would then be between and The post-1860 glacier retreat is not confined to With the exception of Antarctica, it has been well documented everywhere on Earth where ice-covered mountains are present (2). There is no doubt that the Little Ice Age was global in extent and that the post-1860 warming was also In this regard, the Mann et (1) reconstruction is consistent with the mountain snowline The Medieval Warm Period has also left its traces in the Swiss Holzhauser has reconstructed the history of a larchwood aqueduct constructed by medieval farmers (8). It ran from a small mountain lake along the valley occupied by the Grosser Aletsch Glacier, supplying water to an Alpine The aqueduct was first constructed around 1200 (toward the end of the Medieval Warm Period). It was partially destroyed when the glacier advanced in 1240 and had to be totally rerouted after a further advance in 1370 Swiss geologists and geomorphologists agree that the large moraines marking the maximum glacier extent during the Little Ice Age are a composite of debris left behind by a series of Holocene advances (9). For example, soils separating individual advance episodes have been found within the Precise dating has proven difficult, however, and the chronology of these prior advances remains Two recent studies of Holocene climate cycles in the Swiss Alps have greatly improved this Both focus on establishing the times of glacial retreats rather than Holzhauser (8), on the basis of radiocarbon dating of larchwood stumps exposed by the ongoing retreat of the Grosser Aletsch Glacier, finds warm episodes 2400 300 and 1500 200 calendar years Hormes and Schlchter (10-12) have dated wood and peat fragments that are being disgorged from beneath a number of Swiss Radiocarbon dates of a large number of these samples cluster in three major groups centered at 8700, 6600, and 4300 calendar years before The correlation between these Alpine warm phases and the warm phases of Bond's North Atlantic ice-rafting record, although imperfect, is encouraging (see the figure). Climatic oscillations during the Circles show the ratios of iron-stained to total grains (for grains with diameters 63 mm) in a North Atlantic core (3). The chronology is taken from (22). The green (10-12) and yellow (8) boxes are based on radiocarbon dating on wood and peat formed when the glaciers had retreated to positions similar to or up-valley from those at present (see text). CREDIT: FIGURE PREPARED BY AUTHOR FOR THIS PUBLICATION Borehole Thermometry Geothermal heat is produced deep inside Earth, and the shape of the vertical temperature profile measured in a borehole from any point on Earth's surface thus reflects the depth dependence of the thermal conductivity of the crustal The temperature at the surface does not remain constant, however, and the thermal profiles therefore have kinks that reflect past air temperature Mathematical deconvolutions are used to reconstruct these fluctuations from the temperature profile, but because of smoothing due to diffusive spreading of past thermal anomalies, many different time histories fit the observed downhole temperature The modeler selects from these possibilities the temperature history with the least complicated The details are thus lost, and only the broad features of the time history are Deconvolutions of thermal records from holes drilled through the polar ice caps reveal broad maxima that reflect the colder temperatures during glacial In Greenland boreholes, this broad glacial feature is preceded by a narrower one, which requires a temperature oscillation to have occurred in the late The timing of this swing broadly matches that of the Medieval Warm Period to Little Ice Age Its magnitude is about 2C (13). The borehole temperature record for Greenland thus appears to reflect the climate changes thought to have led to the establishment and eventual abandonment of the Viking colonies in southern Greenland (2). It is also consistent with records in the Swiss Far Field Evidence Evidence for the Medieval Warm Period from other parts of the world exists but is spotty and/or From an analysis of 6000 continental borehole thermal records from around the world (14), Huang et conclude that 500 to 1000 years ago, temperatures were warmer than today, but that about 200 years ago, they cooled to a minimum some to below However, as is the case for the thermal profiles in ice, those for continental boreholes are highly Although suggestive, the fluctuation postulated by Huang et does not prove that the Medieval Warm Period was global in Evidence that climate during the latter part of the Medieval Warm Period was much different from today's comes from moisture records for the western United Stine has studied lodgepole pine trees rooted at 8 to 19 m depth in Lake Tenaya in the high Sierra Nevada (15). For the trees to have grown, the lake must have been nearly In contrast, only once during the past 50 years has the lake not overflown during Using radiocarbon dating and ring counting, Stine has shown that for 70 years before 1093 , the lake stood at least 13 m below its outflow spillway, and for 141 years before 1333 , it stood at least 11 m below its spillway (16). Stine has documented similar events at Mono Lake and the Walker River (17). He concludes that late in the Medieval Warm Period, California experienced several decade-long periods of profound If, as Bond et (3) suggest, the cyclic changes in ice-rafted debris composition reflect oscillations in the strength of the Atlantic's conveyor circulation, one might expect temperature changes in Antarctica to have been opposite in phase to those in the North Atlantic, as was the case during the last deglaciation (18). Clow has carried out a deconvolution of the temperature record at the Antarctic Taylor Dome site (19). His reconstruction shows that the air temperature was 3C colder during the time of the Medieval Warm Period than during that of the Little Ice This record suggests that conditions in Antarctica underwent an antiphased oscillation during the Medieval Warm Period-Little Ice Age The Case for a Global Event The case for a global Medieval Warm Period admittedly remains But keeping in mind that most proxies do not have adequate sensitivity, it is interesting that those capable of resolving temperature changes of less than 1C yield results consistent with a global Medieval Warm To test whether this is indeed the case, we require Holocene snowline fluctuation records for tropical and Southern Hemisphere sites and continued studies of wood and peat exposed by the continuing retreat of Northern Hemisphere As the world's mountain glaciers continue to retreat, ever more evidence for past Holocene warm episodes will be One might ask why the strength of the Atlantic's conveyor circulation oscillates on a time scale of one cycle per 1000 to 2000 I suspect that it has to do with the export through the atmosphere of water vapor from the Atlantic to the Pacific The magnitude of this export has been estimated to be ( ) x 106 m3/s (20). If this freshwater loss were not balanced by the export of salt from the Atlantic, the latter's salt content would rise at the rate of about one gram per liter each 1500 Such an increase in salt content would densify cold surface water by an amount equivalent to a 4 to 5 K cooling, thereby strongly altering the buoyancy of surface waters in the North Atlantic and hence their ability to sink to the I believe that this salt export is not continuous but The salt content of the Atlantic periodically builds up until a strong conveyor circulation mode is turned on, causing the salt content to drain Eventually, a weak circulation mode kicks in, allowing the salt content to build up I have suggested previously (21) that an apparent mismatch between radiocarbon and chlorofluorocarbon-based estimates of the rate of deep-water formation in the Southern Ocean may reflect a change in circulation after the Little Ice The geographic pattern of Holocene climate fluctuations remains murky, but several things are The Little Ice Age and the subsequent warming were global in Several Holocene fluctuations in snowline, comparable in magnitude to that of the post-Little Ice Age warming, occurred in the Swiss Borehole records both in polar ice and in wells from all continents suggest the existence of a Medieval Warm Finally, two multidecade-duration droughts plagued the western United States during the latter part of the Medieval Warm I consider this evidence sufficiently convincing to merit an intensification of studies aimed at elucidating Holocene climate fluctuations, upon which the warming due to greenhouse gases is References and Notes Mann, Bradley, Hughes, 26, 759 (1999) [ADS].

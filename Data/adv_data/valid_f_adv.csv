"Dear friends, The scoping of IPCC AR5 will happen in July this In the community there have been opinions raised regarding paleo-science in the next report, whether to have paleo-science dispersed into various topical chapters, forcing, model-evaluation, sea level , or whether it might be best to do as in AR4 to have a separate There are good arguments for both options, and it is not the intent of this email to voice a specific Rather it is important to let the scoping process be aware of all the relevant new paleo-science which whould be assessed in AR5, thereby leading to the need for a strong presence of paleoclimate scientists in the LA-team of AR5, particularly in WG1, but also in In order to make the case that paleo-science continues to be highly relevant for IPCC, Peck and I have agreed to be the editors of a Slide- series (ppt style) which can be used to make the case in the scoping, and which of course could be a useful product for various outreach activities of PAGES and the paleoclimate community at The PAGES office will asssist in producing the slides We therefore send this email to you who worked as LAs in AR4 or who are on SSC or other relevant PAGES panels and ask for your What we hope you can help with is the following: Provide your best examples of key new IPCC (Policy) relevant new results post AR4, accepted after July 2006, that provide compelling arguments for paleoclimate science as a key contributor to Please limit this to the results which are clearly IPCC-relevant Ongoing projects or programmes that are likely to deliver such results in the next 2-3 years can also be The information must, however, be specific and compelling to a non-paleo Send PDF of the paper or other material (like ppt slide) to Peck (user@domain ), Myself and Thorsten Kiefer (user@domain) at PAGES, preferably by May We think this might become a very useful service to our community and to the climate change communities at large, and will be very Hoping to hear back from many of Best wishes Peck and Eystein",0

As is clear from their article, Mann and Jones do undertake a careful calibration and only make comparisons after the calibration, and their comparison figure includes their estimated uncertainty Thus the conclusions they draw (regarding whether recent warming is unprecedented) are valid and are supported by their This does not mean that future work, perhaps using new proxy records or different methods for calibration or for estimating calibration uncertainties, will not change those But it remains true that their conclusions are supported by their As an example of a poor comparison, see the piece by Fred Pearce on page 5 of 12 July 2003 issue of New This is a short news article about the Mann and Jones paper, and it unfortunately shows a comparison figure without the associated calibration That is not a good I mention this in case you were thinking of including a diagram in your article, perhaps showing the Mann and Jones If you do, then it will only be valid for comparing the recent instrumental temperatures with the proxy-based reconstruction of earlier temperatures if the reconstruction uncertainties are Try to avoid the mistake that Fred Pearce Regards Tim",0

"Dear Phil, In June 2003, Climate Research published a paper by David Douglass et The ""et "" includes John Christy and Pat Douglass et attempt to debunk the paper that Tom and I published in JGR in 2001 (""Accounting for the effects of volcanoes and ENSO in comparisons of modeled and observed temperature trends""; JGR 106, 28033-28059). The Douglass et paper claims (and purports to show) that collinearity between ENSO, volcanic, and solar predictor variables is not a serious problem in studies attempting to estimate the effects of these factors on MSU tropospheric Their work has serious scientific flaws - it confuses forcing and response, and ignores strong temporal autcorrelation in the individual predictor variables, incorrectly assuming independence of individual monthly means in the MSU 2LT In the Douglass et view of the world, uncertainties in predictor variables, observations, are The error bars on their estimated ENSO, volcano, and solar regression coefficients are Over a year ago, Tom and I reviewed (for JGR) a paper by Douglass et that was virtually identical to the version that has now appeared in Climate We rejected Prior to this, both Tom and I had engaged in a long and frustrating dialogue with Douglass, in which we attempted to explain to him that there are large uncertainties in the deconvolution of ENSO, volcano, and solar signals in short MSU Douglass chose to ignore all of the comments we made in this exchange, as he later ignored all of the comments we made in our reviews of his rejected JGR Although the Douglass et Climate Research paper is largely a criticism of our previously-published JGR paper, neither Tom nor I were asked to review the paper for Climate Nor were any other coauthors of the Santer et JGR paper asked to review the Douglass et I'm assuming that Douglass specifically requested that neither Tom nor I should be allowed to act as reviwers of his Climate Research It would be interesting to see his cover letter to the In the editorial that you forwarded, Kinne writes the following: ""If someone wishes to criticise a published paper s/he must present facts and arguments and give criticised parties a chance to defend their "" The irony here is that in our own experience, the ""criticised parties"" ( , Tom and I) were NOT allowed to defend their Based on Kinne's editorial, I see little hope for more enlightened editorial decision making at Climate Tom, Richard Smith and I will eventually publish a rebuttal to the Douglass et We'll publish this rebuttal in JGR - not in Climate With best regards, Ben ",0
" Solomon, It is not clear what makes the Wegman Committee Report in your opinion a ""new low"". In scientific study, one part is clearly physical (growth rates of trees, IR absorption, ) and a separate part is the statistical treatment of the Wegman's report is clearly focused on the He is well qualified to analyze statistical methods, as chair of the National Academy of Sciences' (NAS) Committee on Applied and Theoretical Statistics, and a board member of the American Statistical The conclusion of the Committee headed by Wegman is clear - the statistical methods of MBH 98/99 cannot be relied upon to support the claim that the 90's were the hottest decade of the past If one wants to argue with Wegman's conclusion, it will be necessary to show how he has misunderstood or misrepresented the statistical methods used in those Obviously this does not prove that the 90's were not the hottest decade of the past millennium, only that the MBH 98/99 analyses cannot be used to support that claim, nothing more and nothing Anyone interested in paleoclimatology in general, and dendrochronology in particular, should read the recent NAS report and the Wegman Committee Report (or in fact anyone interested in the use of statistics in climatology).

AS I SEE IT David Chartrand A curious nation has witnessed the ongoing shouting match in Kansas over teaching evolution in Soon, all eyes may turn from the state school board in Topeka to a courtroom in Olathe, where hearings are scheduled on a Lenexa mother's lawsuit against the Shawnee Mission School District in connection with the suicide deaths of her two District Judge James Vano should let the case proceed so that Kansas can host an overdue national discussion about a school's duty in regard to the mental health of children and their In the suit, Barbara Mares of Lenexa claims that improper training of teachers and counselors at Shawnee Mission West High School led to the suicide of 16-year-old Jason Mares in February of 2003, followed seven months later by the suicide of his grieving brother, Justin, What happened to the Mares teens is a heart-rending saga of claims and The larger issue, however, is not the allegations by the mother but the reply of the school In seeking dismissal of the suit, the Shawnee Mission district asserts a defense of no A suicide, the district argues, is an ""unforeseeable"" event that a school system has no duty to prevent, especially if it occurs off While mental health experts would disagree about the unforeseen nature of suicide, preventability opens a Pandora's box full of hornet If a tragedy is preventable, then doesn't someone have a duty to prevent it? And if there is a duty, what are the rules? More importantly, how does a school system hold itself out as a champion of children and a partner with parents while disavowing responsibility for the emotional well-being of students? On the other hand, do we want schools, governments or anyone else meddling with the mental health of our kids? If Kansas parents are conflicted about schools teaching their children evolution and sex, how would they react if the Shawnee Mission district announced tomorrow that it planned to institute mental health screenings for all students (something recommended by President Bush's New Freedom Commission on Mental Health)? These questions are too important for schools to ignore or courts to Since the early 1970s, federal civil-rights laws have required schools and universities to address both the physical and emotional disabilities of How far this duty extends is frequently wondered in quiet by grieving Kansas might as well discuss it on a well-lit The nation is already watching David Chartrand is a writer from He's working on a book examining suicide in Johnson Letters: user@domain And report compliance by Much Love, Doyle",0

"Dear Martin and all others, Having read the new manuscript, I would like to draw the attention of all of you to the section about McIntyre&McKitrick vs Mann et I am not entirely happy with this It may be that I am not fully updated about all details on their dispute, but it appears to be some mistakes in this section of our Therefore, I ask all of you to check how this section can be improved and This is very important! If we refer incorrectly to the MM-Mann dispute, I am convinced that all of us will be involved in lengthy frustrating e-mail discussions later I anticipiate this from personal experience! Let's do our best to avoid The problematic bit of text starts on 16, para 4: (""The failure of MM2003 is partly due to a misunderstanding of the stepwise reconstruction method"") and slightly below: (""MM2003 only calculate principal components for the period when all chronologies are present""). I read through the MM2003 paper From what is written there, on 763-765, it appears that they were well aware of the stepwise On 763, about at the middle of the page, they write: ""Following the description of MBH98 our construction is done piecewise for each of the periods listed in Table 8, using the roster of proxies available through the period and the selection of TPCs for each period listed in Table 8"". This is clearly at odds to what is written in our Has it been documented somewhere else that MM2003, despite what they wrote, really misunderstood the stepwise technique? If it is so, we need to insert a If this is not the case, we need to omit the lines about the We also need to explain better why the MM2003 calculations differ from Moreover, our sentence (""MM2003 only calculate principal components for the period when all chronologies are present"") imply that MM2003 only calculated PCs for the period 1820-1971, as this would be the period when all chronologies are present according to the MM2003 Table Obviously, they calculated PCs beyond 1820, as their calculations actually extend back to The problem continues in the legend to our ("" Each of the 212 data series is shown The red rectangle indicates the single block used by MM2003, neglecting all data prior to 1619""). The last sentence is inconsistent with the information in MM2003 in three ways; a) MM2003 clearly show in their Table 8 that they analysed the same blocks of data as b) The year 1619 as a starting point of a data block is inconsistent with MM Table Where does the year 1619 come from? It is not mentioned anywhere in c). The red block implies that MM2003 made calculations back only to 1619, but they did back to Moreover, the numbers given in the graph of our 2 indicate that the total number of series is 211, whereas the text in the legend and also in the main text on 16 says Which number is correct? I suppose that some of you others will know this subject much better than I have just read the MM2003 paper, and find our reference to it to be inconsistent with I hope you all can make efforts to make this bit crystal If not, I fear we will get problems! Finally, I would like to draw your attention to the related sentence in our conclusions on 26: (""Papers which claim to refute have been reviewed and found to contain serious flaws""). Are all of you happy with this statement? Would it sound better with a somewhat less offending sentence, something like: ""Papers which claim to refute have been reviewed and found to essentially contribute with insignificant information that does not affect the consensus, and even to include some "" I attach the MM2003 I will send some comments to the other parts of the text in a separate Cheers, Anders",0

"Curt, I can't believe the nonsense you are spouting, and I furthermore cannot imagine why you would be so presumptuous as to entrain me into an exchange with these What ib earth are you thinking? You're not even remotely correct in your reading of the report, first of The AR4 came to stronger conclusions that IPCC(2001) on the paleoclimate conclusions, finding that the recent warmth is likely anomalous in the last 1300 years, not just the last 1000 The AR4 SPM very much backed up the key findings of the TAR The Jones et al reconstruction which you refer to actually looks very much like ours, and the statement about more variability referred to the 3 reconstructions (Jones et al, Mann et al, Briffa et a) shown in the TAR, not just Mann et The statement also does not commit to whether or not those that show more variability are correct or Some of those that do (for example, Moberg et al and Esper et al) show no similarity to each I find it terribly irresponsible for you to be sending messages like this to Singer and You are speaking from ignorance here, and you must further know how your statements are going to be You could have sought some feedback from others who would have told you that you are speaking out of your depth on By instead simply blurting all of this nonsense out in an email to these sorts charlatans you've done some irreversible shame on you for such irresponsible behavior!

On the other hand, the IPCC seems to have taken a pass on Hansen's The IPCC says their estimates are ""excluding future rapid dynamical changes in ice flow . . . because a basis in published literature is "" In this one respect (sea level rise) I agree with today's Journal editorial that the science is not yet Unfortunately, the editorial runs completely off the tracks thereafter by (1) comparing 2006 2001 surface temperatures, among all the 150 or so years on record, and (2) asserting a ""significant cooling the oceans have undergone since 2003"" based apparently on one published data-set that contradicts all the It is not appropriate to cherry-pick data points this It's like trying to figure out long-term trends in the stock market by comparing today's value of the Dow with last Tuesday's Re high-resolution paleodata, I never liked it that the 2001 IPCC report pictured Mann's without showing Phil's Jones' data was also available at the Focusing so exclusively on Mann was unfair in particular to Mann himself, who thereby became the sole target of criticism in the Wall Street Journal It now seems clear from looking at all the different analyses ( as summarized in last year's NRC review by North et ) that Mann is an outlier though not egregiously Of course, like any good scientist Mann argues that his methods get you closer to the truth than anyone But the bottom line for me is simply that all the different studies find that the rate of warming over the last 50-100 years is unusually high compared with previous Summarizing all this, the latest IPCC does back off a bit from the previous It says on Page 8, ""Some recent studies indicate greater variability [than Mann] in [pre-industrial] Northern Hemisphere temperatures than suggested in the TAR . . ."" The wording is perhaps insufficiently apologetic, but I find it hard to object strenuously to it in light of the main point noted in the last If you want to discuss any of this further, let me I attach my latest presentation -- and would appreciate seeing both Christopher's report mentioned in the Journal editorial and Fred's comment on Rahmstorf's article published in Science last Best regards, Curt",0

Luckily I don't live in [1] Unlike the UK, the public in Australia is very very nave about climate change, mostly because of our governments Kyoto stance, and because there is a proliferation of people with no climate knowledge at all that are prepared to do the gov Hence the general populace is at best confused, and at worst, antagonistic about climate change - for instance, at a recent rural meeting on drought, attended by politicians and around 2000 farmers, a Qld collegue - Dr Roger Stone - spoke about drought from a climatologist point of view, and suggested that climate change may be playing a role in Australias continuing drought+water He was booed and heckled (and unfortunately some politicians applauded when this happened) - that's what we're dealing with due to columists such as the one I sent to Now to your I have seen the latest Mears and Wentz paper (to Science), but am not reviewing it, thank I am reviewing a couple of papers on extremes, so that I can refer to them in the chapter for Somewhat circular, but I kept to my usual The Hadley Centre are working on the day/night issue with sondes, but there are a lot of problems as there are very few sites in the tropics with both and where both can be My own view if that the sondes are overdoing the cooling wrt MSU4 in the lower stratosphere, and some of this likely (IPCC definition) affects the upper troposphere as Sondes are a mess and the fact you get agreement with some of them is Have you looked at individual sondes, rather than averages - particularly tropical ones? LKS is good, but the RATPAC update less As for being on the latest VG analysis, Kostya wanted it to use the surface I thought the model comparisons were a useful aside, so Ben sent me a paper he's submitted with lots of model comparisons that I also thought a useful addition to the As for resolving all this (as opposed to the dogfight) I'm hoping that CCSP will come up with something - a I might be naive in this I hope you are still emailing and talking to Carl and How is CCSP going? Are you still on schedule for end of August for your open review? What will be interesting is to see how IPCC pans out, as we've been told we can't use any article that hasn't been submitted by May This date isn't binding, but Aug 12 is a little more as this is when we must submit our next draft - the one everybody will be able to get access to and comment The science isn't going to stop from now until AR4 comes out in early 2007, so we are going to have to add in relevant new and important I hope it is up to us to decide what is important and So, unless you get something to me soon, it won't be in this It shouldn't matter though, as it will be ridiculous to keep later drafts without We will be open to criticism though with what we do add in subsequent Someone is going to check the final version and the Aug 12 This is partly why I've sent you the rest of this IPCC, me and whoever will get accused of being political, whatever we As you know, I'm not If anything, I would like to see the climate change happen, so the science could be proved right, regardless of the This isn't being political, it is being Cheers Phil IPCC stuff ---- just for interest !!! IPCC ASKED TO COME CLEAN OVER CONTROVERSIAL HOCKEY STICK STUDIES The Committee on Energy and Commerce, 23 June 2005 [2] Joe Barton, Chairman House of Representatives June 23, 2005 To: Rajendra Pachauri Chairman Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change C/O IPCC Secretariat World Meteorological Organization 7 bis Avenue de La Paix 2300 Ch- 1211 Geneva 2 Switzerland Dear Chairman Pachauri: Questions have been raised, according to a February 14, 2005 article in The Wall Street Journal, about the significance of methodological flaws and data errors in studies by Michael Mann and co-authors of the historical record of temperatures and climate We understand that these studies of temperature proxies (tree rings, ice cores, corals, ) formed the basis for a new finding in the 2001 United Nation's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Third Assessment Report (TAR). This finding - that the increase in 20th century northern hemisphere temperatures is ""likely to have been the largest of any century during the past 1,000 years"" and that the ""1990s was the warmest decade and 1998 the warmest year"" - has since been referenced widely and has become a prominent feature of the public debate surrounding climate change However, in recent peer-reviewed articles in Science, Geophysical Research Letters, Energy & Environment, among others, researchers question the results of this As these researchers find, based on the available information, the conclusions concerning temperature histories - and hence whether warming in the 20th century is actually unprecedented - cannot be supported by the Mann In addition, we understand from the February 14 Journal and these other reports that researchers have failed to replicate the findings of these studies, in part because of problems with the underlying data and the calculations used to reach the Questions have also been raised concerning the sharing and dissemination of the data and methods used to perform the For example, according to the January 2005 Energy & Environment, the information necessary to replicate the analyses in the studies has not been made fully available to researchers upon The concerns surrounding these studies reflect upon the quality and transparency of federally funded research and of the IPCC review process - two matters of particular interest to the For example, one concern relates to whether IPCC review has been sufficiently robust and We understand that Michael Mann, the lead author of the studies in question, was also a lead author of the IPCC chapter that assessed and reported this very same work, and that two co-authors of the studies were also contributing authors to the same Given the prominence these studies were accorded in the IPCC TAR, we seek to learn more about the facts and circumstances that led to acceptance and prominent use of this work in the IPCC TAR and to understand what this controversy indicates about the data quality of key IPCC In light of the Committee's jurisdiction over energy policy and certain environmental issues in the House of Representatives, the Committee must have full and accurate information when considering matters relating to climate change We open this review because the dispute surrounding these studies bears directly on important questions about the federally funded work upon which climate studies rely and the quality and transparency of analyses used to support the IPCC assessment With the IPCC currently working to produce a fourth assessment report, addressing questions of quality and transparency in the underlying analyses supporting that assessment, both scientific and economic, are of utmost importance if Congress is eventually going to make policy decisions drawing from this To assist us as we begin this review, and pursuant to Rules X and XI of the House of Representatives, please provide the following information requested below on or before July 11, 2005: Explain the IPCC process for preparing and writing its assessment reports, including, but not limited to: (a) how referenced studies are reviewed and assessed by the relevant Working Group; (b) the steps taken by lead authors, reviewers, and others to ensure the data underlying the studies forming the basis for key findings - particularly proxy and temperature data - are accurate and up to date; and (c) the IPCC requirements governing the quality of data used in What specifically did IPCC do to check the quality of the Mann studies and underlying data, cited in the TAR? Did IPCC seek to ensure the studies could be replicated? What is your position with regard to: (a) the recent challenges to the quality of the Mann data, (b) related questions surrounding the sharing of methods and research for others to test the validity of these studies, and (c) what this controversy indicates about the data quality of key IPCC studies? What did IPCC do to ensure the quality of data for other prominent historical temperature or proxy studies cited in the IPCC, including the Folland and Jones studies that were sources for the graphic accompanying the Mann graphic in the Summary for Policy Makers? Are the data and methodologies for such works complete and available for other researchers to test and replicate? Explain (a) the facts and circumstances by which Michael Mann served as a lead author of the very chapter that prominently featured his work and (b) by which his work became a finding and graphical feature of the TAR Summary for Explain (a) how IPCC ensures objectivity and independence among section contributors and reviewers, (b) how they are chosen, and (c) how the chapters, summaries, and the full report are approved and what any such approval signifies about the quality and acceptance of particular research Identify the people who wrote and reviewed the historical temperature-record portions of the TAR, particularly Section , ""Is the Recent Warming Unusual?"" and explain all their roles in the preparation of the TAR, including, but not limited to, the specific roles in the writing and review Given the questions about Mann data, has the Working Group I or the IPCC made any changes to specific procedures or policies, including policies for checking the quality of data, for the forthcoming Fourth Assessment Report? If so, explain in detail any such changes, and why they were Does the IPCC or Working Group I have policies or procedures regarding the disclosure and dissemination of scientific data referenced in the reports?

"'I think he could come apart' By Glenn Thrush 05/09/2016 05:23 AM EDT Mark Salter, the most prominent and most defiant Republican to announce his support of Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump, thinks the 2016 campaign could literally - no joke - drive the billionaire developer Salter, one of McCain's top aides during the 2008 campaign and the co-author of his books, spent the final few doomed weeks of the race against Barack Obama in a glum fog - knowing his boss, buddy and alter ego would lose, and It was a rotten experience, but Salter, the guest on POLITICO's ""Off Message"" podcast this week, sees in Trump's rise (and potential fall) a sliver of redemption for McCain, with the possibility of paying back Trump for disrespecting his Eight years ago, McCain was stoic and self-deprecating in defeat - one of the few fringe benefits of having endured the far greater trials of near-death in a Hanoi But Salter thinks Trump, who infamously mocked McCain for getting ""captured,"" will melt like Fontina in a fondue pot in the glare of general election when he realizes he can't beat ""He's going to lose, and I think he's got kind of unstable personality to begin with,"" Salter told me last week, a couple of days after sparking a mini-frenzy by tweeting that his loathing for Trump had metamorphosed into - gasp - support for Hashtag: Salter, sitting in his writer's-warren-office in Old Town Alexandria, said he wouldn't venture a guess on Trump's mental Then he smiled, and went right ""I think he could come apart, you know, in some kind of visible way,"" the 61-year-old Salter ""I think that's quite I'm not a psychiatrist, but there is something wrong with [the] "" On Sunday, Clinton told ""Face the Nation"" host John Dickerson that she's had ""a lot of outreach"" from Republicans interested in possibly defecting to her So far, however, they have been keeping their apostasy to themselves, apart from the occasional wayward Koch brother and a handful of centrist GOPers like Ambivalence is likely to be a bigger problem than outright desertion for Trump this With leading conservatives like House Speaker Paul Ryan urging a watchful waiting period before endorsing Trump, many Republicans are predicting depressed turnout in the general GOP moneymen are focusing their efforts on saving the Senate and - incredibly - the House from Trump blowback, and some senators are already talking about capitulating and green-lighting Obama's Supreme Court For his part, Salter confesses he's not entirely sold on Clinton despite his tweet; he's gotten a lot of encouraging emails from fellow Republicans, albeit few Im-joining-you offers and plenty of hate from pro-Trump ""I'm sure 10 minutes into Hillary Clinton's inaugural address I'll sort of be disappointed,"" he ""[But] her foreign policy would probably be a modest to maybe substantial improvement over the I've never voted for a Democrat for president in my But she is the more conservative choice and the least reckless She won't - or at least she hasn't said that she would - take the out of She hasn't encouraged other nations to get their own nuclear She hasn't threatened to slap a 45 percent tariff on imported "" But it all might be for naught: If a good third-party candidate pops up, he might When I ask Salter of there's anything Trump could do to change his mind, he ""He'd have to have a brain "" (Subscribe to POLITICO's Off Message podcast with Glenn Thrush) When McCain talks about Trump, you can see the little drill instructor inside his head screaming for him to show His response to the diss from Trump - who sat out Vietnam with educational deferments followed by the discovery of a bone spur in his foot - was tempered, and the worst he's said about the reality star so far this cycle is that Trump will hurt him with Hispanic Arizona's junior senator Jeff Flake has taken a much harder line - saying he simply can't endorse who backs a policy as ""nutty"" as the Mexico Salter, whose career has consisted of a three-decade McCain mind-meld, suggests McCain is a little less diplomatic about the GOP frontrunner in private, but will only hint at his friend's pique with the ""captured"" ""I talked to him when that happened and, you know, I'm sure it irritated him,"" said Salter, who viewed the comment as a net positive in McCain's reelection campaign because it reminded voters the 79-year-old incumbent is a war ""I said to him, 'Well, if we're going to spend the weekend talking about John McCain, the POW, it's '"" Salter? He hates Trump with the intense passion of a man who wants to return a sucker punch delivered to his best ""He's just an asshole,"" said Salter of ""I mean, you don't want a guy like that for a neighbor, for a friend, for a member of your church, for a colleague, for a You wouldn't want - really, you wouldn't - you know, if he had a flat tire, you wouldn't pull over and offer to "" McCain, he told me, doesn't view Trump as a draft-dodger - but Salter has no trouble making that connection ""Trump's sort of breezy, which is galling, given his own lack of military service,"" says Salter, who has written several books about McCain and other service members who were killed or grievously wounded under ""[Trump] said he was waging his own personal Vietnam, you know, avoiding venereal So yeah, it just shows you what a vain, glorious, foolish, ignorant, low-character, bum of a guy Trump "" Speechwriters have a tendency to bend their rhetorical tendencies to the will of the boss (in a telling passage of a much-discussed New York Times Magazine profile last weekend, Obama speechwriter and foreign policy aide Ben Rhodes remarked, ""I don't know anymore where I begin and Obama ends""). It works the other way 'round with Salter, whose unmistakable writing voice has had a profound impact on McCain's Left to his own devices, McCain, the son and grandson of decorated Navy officers, speaks in the clipped jargon of the dreadnought gentry -- punchy, profane, with an impatience of a flyboy waiting under the wing for the refueling crew to Salter gives him elevation, a loftier, etched-in-marble style uncommon in modern politics -- owing more to Roman generals or to military historians like John Keegan than the focused-group word salad served up by most Senate offices or presidential Salter is gloomy and self-dismissive (his Twitter motto is ""I used to almost be somebody"") but he takes deep pride in his collaborations with McCain, especially their books together and the senator's 1993 commencement speech to the Naval Academy, which hangs in a triptych next to Salter's ""It took longer than Usually it's pretty quick with him, because we'd been doing it a long time,"" he told me, voice choked with ""He was involved in every paragraph of I think we got - we were close right from the go, You know, we just have similar "" For all Salter's criticism of Trump, McCain's team faced similar rebuke for tapping Sarah Palin (who pulled a reverse-Trump, morphing into a reality star after running for office), a candidate he now acknowledges was unfit for the nation's second-highest ""We did rush the vet,"" he says of the whirlwind, last-minute decision pushed by McCain campaign manager Steve Schmidt - and seconded by ""Do you think you opened the door a crack for a Trump-type candidate because of Palin?""

"Mike and Tom and others My silence to do with the specific issue of the Soon and Baliunas conveys general strong agreement with all the general remarks (and restatement of many in various forms ) by Tom Crowley, Mike Mann, Neville Nichols and now Tom Wigley regarding the scientific value of the paper and its obvious methodological I have to say that I tended towards the ""who cares"" camp , in as much as those who are concerned about the science should see through it anyway . I also admit to thinking that some of you seem a little paranoid (especially in the implication that Climate Research is a pro sceptic journal) but I am changing my mind regarding the way the ""meaning"" of the BS paper is being presented to the wider public - in response to some very poor recent reporting in the British press and several requests from the US that indicate that those of you who work there can not simply rely on the weight of good science eventually showing through as regards the public perception . As Tom states , there are uncertainties and ""difficulties"" with our current knowledge of Hemispheric temperature histories and valid criticisms or shortcomings in much of our This is the nature of the beast - and I have been loathe to become embroiled in polarised debates that force too simplistic a presentation of the state of the art or ""consensus view"". Having read Tom W's and Mike's latest statements I now agree about the need to make some public comment on BS . (I too have given my personal view of the work to David Appell who I assume is writing a balanced view of this paper for Scientific American). I see little need to get involved in a over detailed critic of all the points in the paper , because I am not sure what audience would benefit from it, but the points made by those I listed above could usefully be fashioned into a simple letter to Climate Research, signed by those who This would then go on record as a simple statement of refutation of the method employed and corresponding limitation of the work for informing the ""global warming "" debate . This could be quickly citable when talking to the The one additional point I would make that seems to have been overlooked in the discussions up to now , is the invalidity of assuming that the existence of a global Medieval Warm period , even if shown to be as warm as the current climate , somehow negates the possibility of enhanced greenhouse The business of constructing a reliable climate history is only one part of establishing the relative roles of natural and anthropogenic forcings, now and in the Without reference to the roles of natural forcings in recent and past times , comparisons with other periods are of very limited value So I agree with Tom and Mike that something needs to go ""on record"" . The various papers apparently in production, regardless of their individual emphasis or approaches, will find their way in to the literature and the next IPCC can sift and present their message(s) as it , but in the meantime , why not a simple statement of the shortcomings of the BS paper as they have been listed in these messages and why not in Climate Research?

"Thanks for your response Keith, For all: Walked into this hornet's nest this morning! Keith and Phil have both raised some very good And I should point out that Chris, through no fault of his own, but probably through ME not conveying my thoughts very clearly to the others, definitely overstates any singular confidence I have in my own (Mann et al) I believe strongly that the strength in our discussion will be the fact that certain key features of past climate estimates are robust among a number of quasi-independent and truly independent estimates, each of which is not without its own limitations and potential And I certainly don't want to abuse my lead authorship by advocating my own I am perfectly amenable to keeping Keith's series in the plot, and can ask Ian Macadam (Chris?) to add it to the plot he has been preparing (nobody liked my own color/plotting conventions so I've given up doing this myself). The key thing is making sure the series are vertically aligned in a reasonable I had been using the entire 20th century, but in the case of Keith's, we need to align the first half of the 20th century w/ the corresponding mean values of the other series, due to the late 20th century So if Chris and Tom (?) are ok with this, I would be happy to add Keith's That having been said, it does raise a conundrum: We demonstrate (through comparining an exatropical averaging of our nothern hemisphere patterns with Phil's more extratropical series) that the major discrepancies between Phil's and our series can be explained in terms of spatial sampling/latitudinal emphasis (seasonality seems to be secondary here, but probably explains much of the residual differences). But that explanation certainly can't rectify why Keith's series, which has similar seasonality and latitudinal emphasis to Phil's series, differs in large part in exactly the opposite direction that Phil's does from This is the problem we all picked up on (everyone in the room at IPCC was in agreement that this was a problem and a potential distraction/detraction from the reasonably concensus viewpoint we'd like to show w/ the Jones et al and Mann et al So, if we show Keith's series in this plot, we have to comment that ""something else"" is responsible for the discrepancies in this Perhaps Keith can help us out a bit by explaining the processing that went into the series and the potential factors that might lead to it being ""warmer"" than the Jones et al and Mann et al series?? We would need to put in a few words in this Otherwise, the skeptics have an field day casting doubt on our ability to understand the factors that influence these estimates and, thus, can undermine faith in the I don't think that doubt is scientifically justified, and I'd hate to be the one to have to give it fodder! The recent Crowley and Lowery multiproxy estimate is an important additional piece of information which I have indeed incorporated into the revised Tom actually estimates the same mean warming since the 17th century in his reconstruction, that we estimate in ours, so it is an added piece of information that Phil and I are probably in the ballpark (Tom has used a somewhat independent set of high and low-resolution proxy data and a very basic compositing methodology, similar to Bradley and Jones, so there is some independent new information in this One other key result with respect to our own work is from a paper in the press in ""Earth Interactions"". An unofficial version is available here: THe key point we emphasize in this paper is that the low-frequency variability in our hemispheric temperature reconstruction is basically the same if we don't use any dendroclimatic indicators at all (though we certainly resolve less variance, can't get a skillful reconstruction as far back, and there are notable discrepancies at the decadal and interannual timescales). A believe I need to add a sentence to the current discussion on this point, since there is an unsubstantiated knee-jerk belief that our low-frequency variability is suppressed by the use of tree ring We have shown that this is not the case: (see here: and specifically, the plot and discussion here: Ironically, you'll note that there is more low-frequency variability when the tree ring data are used, then when only other proxy and historical/instrumental data are used! SO I think we're in the position to say/resolve somewhat more than, frankly, than Keith does, about the temperature history of the past And the issues I've spelled out all have to be dealt with in the One last point: We will (like it or not) have SUBSTANTIAL opportunity/requirement to revise much of this discussion after review, so we don't have to resolve everything Just the big picture and the important I'm sure we can can up with an arrangement that is amenable to all, and I'm looking forward to hearing back from Keith, Phil, and Chris in particular about the above, so we can quickly move towards finalizing a first Looking forward to hearing back w/ comments, mike",0

"Chris and John (and Mike for info), I'm basically reiterating Mike's There seem to be two lots of suggestions doing the Both are basically Recent paleo doesn't show This basically stems back to Keith Briffa's paper in Nature in 1998 (Vol 391, pp678-682). In this it was shown that northern boreal forest conifers don't pick up all the observed warming since about the late It was suggested that some other factor or a combination of factors related to human-induced pollution ( nitrogen deposition, higher levels of CO2, ozone depletion etc). Hence in a new paper submitted to JGR recently we develop a new standardization approach (called age banding) and produce a large-scale reconstruction (calibrated over the period 1881-1960 against NH land north of 20N) back to If you want a copy of this can you email Keith and he'll send copies once he's back from This background is to illustrate how Singer et al distort The new reconstruction only runs to 1960 as did earlier ones based solely on tree-ring All the other long series (Mike's, Tom Crowley's and mine) include other proxy information (ice cores, corals, historical records, sediments and early instrumental records as well as tree-ring width data, which are only marginally affected). All these series end around 1980 or in the early We don't have paleo data for much of the last 20 It would require tremendous effort and resources to update a lot of the paleo series because they were collected during the 1970s/early It is possible to add the instrumental series on from about 1980 (Mike sought of did this in his Nature article to say 1998 was the warmest of the millennium - and I did something similar in ) but there is no way Singer can say the proxy data doesn't record the last 20 years of warming, as we don't have enough of the proxy series after about takes the argument further saying that as trees don't see all the warming since about 1960 the instrumental records recently must be in error ( this group believes the trees and not the instrumental records). This piece by Idso and Idso seems to want to have the argument whichever suits Everyone knows it was cooler during the Little Ice Age and warmer in the Medieval Warm All of the millennial-long reconstructions show these features, but they are just less pronounced than people believed in the 1960s and 1970s, when there was much less paleo data and its spatial extent was limited to the eastern and Far East The issue seems to revolve around the average temperatures we have for earlier centuries in the I use the argument that for the instrumental period we need sites located over much of the NH (land and marine) regions in order to claim we have a reasonable record for the whole We wouldn't dream of extending the NH series based on longer European records and in the extreme just CET, so with the paleo data we need records from as many regions as The coverage still could be better, but it is far better than it was 25 years ago, when the ideas embodied in the MWP and LIA became sort of The typical comments I've heard, generally relate to the MWP, and say that crops and vines were grown further north than they are now (the vines grown in York in Viking times etc). Similarly, statements about frost fairs and freezing of the Baltic so armies could cross Frost fairs on the Thames in London occurred more readily because the tidal limit was at the old London Bridge (the 5ft weir under it). The bridge was rebuilt around the 1840s and the frost fairs If statements continue to be based on historical accounts they will be easy to knock down with all the usual phrases such as the need for contemporary sources, reliable chroniclers and annalists, who witnessed the events rather than through As you all know various people in CRU (maybe less so now) have considerable experience in dealing with this type of Christian Pfister also has a lifetime of experience of There is a paper coming out from the CRU conference with a reconstruction of summer and winter temps for Holland back to about AD 800, which shows the 20th century warmer than all Evidence is sparser before 1400 but the workers at KNMI (Aryan van Engelen et ) take all this into I hope this is of use and hasn't been a total waste of In Victoria last month, did you discuss how the policymaker's summary will report the millennial temperature series ?

"Dear Ben, many thanks for the full response to my I think my confusion arose from the discussion on RealClimate (which prompted our earlier communication on this topic), which clearly suggested that the observed trend should be expected to lie within the spread of the models, rather than neccessarily being close to the mean as the models are stochastic simulations (which seemed reasonable). I've just re-read that post, the key paragraph from [1] is as follows: ""The interpretation of this is a little unclear (what exactly does the sigma refer to?), but the most likely interpretation, and the one borne out by looking at their Table IIa, is that sigma is calculated as the standard deviation of the model In that case, the formula given defines the uncertainty on the estimate of the mean - how well we know what the average trend really But it only takes a moment to realise why that is Imagine there were 1000's of simulations drawn from the same distribution, then our estimate of the mean trend would get sharper and sharper as N However, the chances that any one realisation would be within those error bars, would become smaller and Instead, the key standard deviation is simply sigma That defines the likelihood that one realisation ( the real world) is conceivably drawn from the distribution defined by the "" I had therefore expected the test to use the standard deviations of both the models and the observations (which would give a flat plot in 5B and there would be an obvious overlap of the uncertainties in 6a at say 500hPa). best regards Gavin -----Original Message----- From: Ben Santer [[2]mailto:user@domain] Sent: Fri 10/31/2008 4:06 AM To: Cawley Gavin Dr (CMP) Cc: Jones Philip Prof (ENV); Gavin Schmidt; Thorne, Peter; Tom Wigley Subject: Re: Possible error in recent IJC paper Dear Gavin, Thanks very much for your email, and for your interest in our recent paper in the International Journal of Climatology (IJoC). There is no error in equation (12) in our IJoC Let me try to answer the questions that you The first term under the square root in our equation (12) is a standard estimate of the variance of a sample mean - see, , ""Statistical Analysis in Climate Research"", by Francis Zwiers and Hans von Storch, Cambridge organization Press, 1999 (their equation , page 86). The second term under the square root sign is a very different beast - an estimate of the variance of the observed As we point out, our d1 test is very similar to a standard Student's t-test of differences in means (which involves, in its denominator, the square root of two pooled sample variances). In testing the statistical significance of differences between the model average trend and a single observed trend, Douglass et were wrong to use sigma_SE as the sole measure of trend uncertainty in their statistical Their test assumes that the model trend is uncertain, but that the observed trend is The observed trend is not a ""mean"" quantity; it is NOT Douglass et made a demonstrably false Bottom line: sigma_SE is a standard estimate of the uncertainty in a sample mean - which is why we use it to characterize uncertainty in the estimate of the model average trend in equation (12). It is NOT appropriate to use sigma_SE as the basis for a statistical test between two uncertain The uncertainty in the estimates of both modeled AND observed trend needs to be explicitly incorporated in the design of any statistical test seeking to compare modeled and observed Douglass et incorrectly ignored uncertainties in observed I hope this answers your first question, and explains why there is no inconsistency between the formulation of our d1 test in equation (12) and the comments that we made in point #3 [immediately before equation (12)]. As we note in point #3, ""While sigma_SE is an appropriate measure of how well the multi-model mean trend can be estimated from a finite sample of model results, it is not an appropriate measure for deciding whether this trend is consistent with a single observed "" We could perhaps have made point #3 a little clearer by inserting ""imperfectly-known"" before ""observed trend"". I thought, however, that the uncertainty in the estimate of the observed trend was already made very clear in our point #1 (on page 7, bottom of column 2). To answer your second question, d1 gives a reasonably flat line in Figure 5B because the first term under the square root sign in equation (12) (the variance of the model average trend, which has a dependence on N, the number of models used in the test) is roughly a factor of 20 smaller than the second term under the square root sign (the variance of the observed trend, which has no dependence on N). The behaviour of d1 with synthetic data is therefore dominated by the second term under the square root sign - which is why the black lines in Figure 5B are In answer to your third question, our Figure 6A provides only one of the components from the denominator of our d1 test (sigma_SE). Figure 6A does not show the standard errors in the observed trends at discrete pressure Had we attempted to show the observed standard errors at individual pressure levels, we would have produced a very messy Figure, since Figure 6A shows results from 7 different observational We could of course have performed our d1 test at each discrete pressure This would have added another bulky Table to an already lengthy We judged that it was sufficient to perform our d1 test with the synthetic MSU T2 and T2LT temperature trends calculated from the seven radiosonde datasets and the climate model The results of such tests are reported in the final paragraph of Section As we point out, the d1 test ""indicates that the model-average signal trend (for T2LT) is not significantly different (at the 5% level) from the observed signal trends in three of the more recent radiosonde products (RICH, IUK, and RAOBCORE )."" So there is no inconsistency between the formulation of our d1 test in equation (12) and the results displayed in Figure Thanks again for your interest in our paper, and my apologies for the delay in replying to your email - I have been on travel (and out of email contact) for the past 10 With best regards, Ben",0

Make sure that your preacher, pastor or minister stands up against this bomb in every nation (abomination): THE DEBT As OUR elders knew: 1/ Print & coin your own money; if you let the talmudic moneychangers handle money, you will always be in ""debt""! 2/ Use 3/ Stiff the (unconstitutional & confiscatory tax scam against ""We, the People""). 4/ Trust in GOD, not the damned banksters & their gutless minions: all 535 'congressmen'. 5/ Get a REAL educations: a/ b/ c/ Note: With chaos, disorder and lawlessness during this coming FINANCIAL COLLAPSE, the 666 chinks, hindus, and other orientals will unleash the largest and most powerful armies, navies and air forces against every Western man, woman & They have the most modern military equipment and can out-man and out-gun the Western nations because the West has been downsizing its military and closing military bases while the 666 asians are currently arming to the teeth! Additionally, millions of 666 asians have entered every Western nation to learn the road systems, harbors, buildings and infrastructure of every city and The asian gangsters (triads, yakuza, hindus & mossad) have turned cities into crime zones of turf Solution: for your own protection, move out and away from the West coast (a beach-head for chinks & hindus along with huge triad-controlled ""china towns"": Los Angeles, Long Beach, San Francisco, Vancouver, ). Move away and out of the north eastern seaboard states & big cities, particularly all cities north of Richmond, In Canada, the chinks have set up shop in all the major cities, They are not in the USA, Canada, or any other Western nations to ""enrich OUR culture"" or assimilate with Western, occidental humanity----they are OUR eternal enemies!

"Dear Mike, (and interested colleagues) Given the list of people to whom you have chosen to circulate your message(s), we thought we should make a short, somewhat formal, response I am happy to reserve my informal response until we are face to face! We did not respond earlier because we had more pressing tasks to deal This is not the place to go into a long or over-detailed response to all of your comments but a few brief remarks might help to clear up a couple of You consider our commentary on Ed and Jan's paper ""more flawed than even the paper itself"" on the basis that scaling the relationship between full Northern Hemisphere and extratropical Northern Hemisphere is much more problematic than even any of the seasonal issues we In fact we did not do The curve labelled Mann99 in our figure was, in fact, based on the average of only the land areas, north of 20 degrees N, extracted from your spatially-resolved We then scaled it by calibration against the instrumental annual temperatures from the same This is, just as you stress in your comments on the Esper et paper, what should have been We think that this single point addresses virtually of all your We can, of course, argue about what this means for the pre-1400 part of your reconstruction, when only 1 EOF was reconstructed, but the essential message is that we did our best to exclude the tropics (and the oceans too!) from your series so that it could more readily be compared with the other The fact that we have used only the extra-tropical land from your data is not clear from the text, so we can see why you may not have appreciated this, but we think you will concede that this fact negates much of what you say and that we acted ""more correctly"" than you Blame Science for being so mean with their space allocation if you want! Remember that this was an unrefereed piece and we felt justified in concentrating on one issue; that of the importance of the method of scaling and its effect on apparent ""absolute"" reconstruction In our draft, we went on to say that this was crucial for issues of simple model sensitivity studies and climate detection, citing the work of Tom Crowley and Myles Allen, but this fell foul of the editor's You also express concerns about the calibration of Esper et ( , you say ""if the authors had instead used the actual (unsmoothed) instrumental record for the extratropical northern hemisphere to scale their record, their reconstruction would be much closer to MBH99""). This point is wholly consistent with our discussion in the perspective piece, and indeed we show that in absolute terms the records are closer when Esper et is calibrated using unsmoothed data but since the variance is also reduced, the significance of the differences may be just as Finally, we have to say that we do not feel constrained in what we say to the media or write in the scientific or popular press, by what the sceptics will say or do with our We can only strive to do our best and address the issues Some ""sceptics"" have their own dishonest agenda - we have no doubt of If you believe that I, or Tim, have any other objective but to be open and honest about the uncertainties in the climate change debate, then I am disappointed in you Best regards Keith (and Tim)",0

"Hi everyone Let me say that I don't mind what you put in the policy makers summary if there is a general However some general discussion would be valuable . First , like Phil , I think that the supposed separation of the tree-ring reconstruction from the others on the grounds that it is not a true ""multi-proxy"" series is hard to What is true is that these particular tree-ring data best represent SUMMER temperatures mostly at the northern boreal forest By virtue of this , they also definately share significant variance with Northern Hemisphere land and land and marine ANNUAL temperatures - but at decadal and multidecadal timescales - simply by virtue of the fact that these series correlated with the former at these The multi proxy series (Mann et al . Jones et al) supposedly represent annual and summer seasons respectively, and both contain large proportions of tree-ring The latest tree-ring density curve ( our data that have been processed to retain low frequency information) shows more similarity to the other two series- as do a number of other lower resolution data ( Bradley et al, Peck et al ., and new Crowley series - see our recent Science piece) whether this represents 'TRUTH' however is a difficult I know Mike thinks his series is the 'best' and he might be right - but he may also be too dismissive of other data and possibly over confident in his (or should I say his use of other's). After all, the early ( pre-instrumental) data are much less reliable as indicators of global temperature than is apparent in modern calibrations that include them and when we don't know the precise role of particular proxies in the earlier portions of reconstruction it remains problematic to assign genuine confidence limits at multidecadal and longer I still contend that multiple regression against the recent very trendy global mean series is potentially You could calibrate the proxies to any number of seasons , regardless of their true optimum response . Not for a moment am I saying that the tree-ring , or any other proxy data, are better than Mike's series - indeed I am saying that the various reconstructions are not independent but that they likely contribute more information about reality together than they do I do believe , that it should not be taken as read that Mike's series (or Jone's et for that matter) is THE CORRECT I prefer a Figure that shows a multitude of reconstructions ( similar to that in my Science piece). Incidently, arguing that any particular series is probably better on the basis of what we now about glaciers or solar output is flaky Glacier mass balance is driven by the difference mainly in winter accumulation and summer ablation , filtered in a complex non-linear way to give variously lagged tongue advance/retreat .Simple inference on the precidence of modern day snout positions does not translate easily into absolute (or relative) temperature levels now or in the Similarly, I don't see that we are able to substantiate the veracity of different temperature reconstructions through reference to Solar forcing theories without making assumptions on the effectiveness of (seasonally specific ) long-term insolation changes in different parts of the globe and the contribution of solar forcing to the observed 20th century warming . There is still a potential problem with non-linear responses in the very recent period of some biological proxies ( or perhaps a fertilisation through high CO2 or nitrate input) . I know there is pressure to present a nice tidy story as regards 'apparent unprecedented warming in a thousand years or more in the proxy data' but in reality the situation is not quite so We don't have a lot of proxies that come right up to date and those that do (at least a significant number of tree proxies ) some unexpected changes in response that do not match the recent I do not think it wise that this issue be ignored in the For the record, I do believe that the proxy data do show unusually warm conditions in recent I am not sure that this unusual warming is so clear in the summer responsive I believe that the recent warmth was probably matched about 1000 years I do not believe that global mean annual temperatures have simply cooled progressively over thousands of years as Mike appears to and I contend that that there is strong evidence for major changes in climate over the Holocene (not Milankovich) that require explanation and that could represent part of the current or future background variability of our I think the Venice meeting will be a good place to air these Finally I appologise for this rather self-indulgent ramble, but I thought I may as well voice these points to you . I too would be happy to go through the recent draft of the chapter when it becomes cheers to all Keith",0

"Trump hammering out party fundraising agreement By Kenneth Vogel, Eli Stokols and Alex Isenstadt 05/09/2016 05:26 PM EDT Donald Trump's campaign is hashing out the details of an agreement with Republican Party leaders that could allow the presumptive GOP presidential nominee to raise six-figure checks for his presidential campaign, multiple sources with direct knowledge of the negotiations tell The fundraising agreement was among the subjects discussed at a Monday meeting at the Republican National Committee's Washington offices between top RNC officials, including chairman Reince Priebus, and senior Trump aides, including campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, senior adviser Paul Manafort and political director Rick Wiley, according to the The talks represent the first formal steps towards a merger between the official apparatus of the Republican Party and a candidate who many party leaders scorned until recently, and about whom there remains deep leeriness in some Republican Since Trump essentially clinched the GOP nomination with a win in last week's Indiana primary, his staff has moved quickly to put their stamp on the party's general election planning Wiley has paid several visits to the party's headquarters on Capitol Hill to assess its efforts, according to the The campaign also has been discussing convention-related issues with the RNC, including credentials and rules, the sources And deputy campaign manager Michael Glassner this week is set to lead a delegation to the convention site, Cleveland's Quicken Loans Arena, to receive a briefing from RNC officials involved in planning for the July event, as POLITICO first reported last Fundraising was not a major focus of Monday's meetings, according to RNC senior strategist Sean ""It was 3 ½ hours on briefings from all the RNC divisions regarding the capabilities and resources that we have been compiling to win in November,"" said Spicer, who attended the The conversations are also partly an effort to lay the groundwork for a Thursday meeting in Washington between Trump, Priebus and House Speaker Paul Ryan, who announced last Thursday that he is withholding his endorsement until Trump outlines a stronger commitment to conservative The perception among Trump's inner circle is that Ryan is attempting to leverage his position as chairman of the Cleveland convention into securing a deal that protects the party's control over vendor contracts and how the money raised jointly by the party and Trump's campaign is ""Trump is a tough negotiator, understands the history of what he's entitled to here,"" another Trump confidant ""They want the RNC to be autonomous but they'll work with the Trump They need Trump to help raise the money but they want their vendors to be the ones to spend the "" But Trump may be more reliant on the national party than past presidential nominees, since his campaign has invested relatively little in field staff, voter data or a fundraising Some of Trump's infrastructure deficiencies can be traced to his unwillingness to dig deep into his own fortune to finance his campaign, which he has pledged from the beginning to Entering into a joint fundraising agreement and leaning on the party for cash and staff would help fill that void, but also could undermine his rhetoric about being independent from the party's donor To view online: To change your alert settings, please go to or email was sent to user@domain by: POLITICO, LLC 1000 Wilson Arlington, VA, 22209, USA To unsubscribe,",0

"Dear Tim, Thanks very much for your I greatly appreciate the additional information that you've given I am a bit conflicted about what we should IJC published a paper with egregious statistical Douglass et was essentially a commentary on work by myself and colleagues - work that had been previously published in Science in 2005 and in Chapter 5 of the first CCSP Report in To my knowledge, none of the authors or co-authors of the Santer et Science paper or of CCSP Chapter 5 were used as reviewers of Douglass et I am assuming that, when he submitted his paper to IJC, Douglass specifically requested that certain scientists should be excluded from the review Such an approach is not defensible for a paper which is largely a comment on previously-published It would be fair and reasonable to give IJC the opportunity to ""set the record straight"", and correct the harm they have done by publication of Douglass et I use the word ""harm"" The author and coauthors of the Douglass et IJC paper are using this paper to argue that ""Nature, not CO2, rules the climate"", and that the findings of Douglass et invalidate the ""discernible human influence"" conclusions of previous national and international scientific Quick publication of a response to Douglass et in IJC would go some way towards setting the record I am troubled, however, by the very real possibility that Douglass et will have the last word on this In my opinion (based on many years of interaction with these guys), neither Douglass, Christy or Singer are capable of admitting that their paper contained serious scientific Their ""last word"" will be an attempt to obfuscate rather than They are not interested in improving our scientific understanding of the nature and causes of recent changes in atmospheric They are solely interested in advancing their own It is telling and troubling that Douglass et ignored radiosonde data showing substantial warming of the tropical troposphere - data that were in accord with model results - even though such data were in their Such behaviour constitutes intellectual I strongly believe that leaving these guys the last word is inherently If IJC are interested in publishing our contribution, I believe it's fair to ask for the following: 1) Our paper should be regarded as an independent contribution, not as a comment on Douglass et This seems reasonable given i) The substantial amount of new work that we have done; and ii) The fact that the Douglass et paper was not regarded as a comment on Santer et (2005), or on Chapter 5 of the 2006 CCSP Report - even though Douglass et clearly WAS a comment on these two 2) If IJC agrees to 1), then Douglass et should have the opportunity to respond to our contribution, and we should be given the chance to Any response and reply should be published side-by-side, in the same issue of I'd be grateful if you and Phil could provide me with some guidance on 1) and 2), and on whether you think we should submit to Feel free to forward my email to Glenn With best regards, Ben",0
"Trump campaign rift gets personal By Kenneth Vogel and Ben Schreckinger 05/25/2016 05:17 AM EDT The internal struggle for control of Donald Trump's presidential campaign is getting personal, with allies of feuding campaign manager Corey Lewandowski and chairman Paul Manafort increasingly turning to shadowy tactics to try to sully their The battle, which was already toxic even by the standards of notoriously vicious internecine presidential campaign spats, escalated last week, even as Trump moved to clarify the official hierarchy atop his campaign by creating a new position - campaign chairman and chief strategist - for Lewandowski's enemies around the campaign, after months of circulating rumors about his personal life, had a hand in planting a suggestive item about his emotional argument with a campaign staffer in a New York tabloid, according a person with direct knowledge of how the item came to And Lewandowski's rivals also circulated a news report about him shopping a book, in an effort to raise questions about his commitment to Trump's campaign, according to people familiar with the (Lewandowski denied the ) Lewandowski's supporters, in turn, have urged Trump and his representatives to examine Manafort's personal life, as well as the lobbying done by Manafort and his associates, according to people on both sides of the Lewandowski-Manafort Perhaps fittingly, much of the feud has played out on the same social media battleground and using the same conspiratorial tone that Trump himself has exploited to great effect to belittle his But the tug-of-war also has potentially serious implications for the presumptive GOP nominee's general election matchup with likely Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Many individuals familiar with the Trump campaign - including campaign staffers and people who work with them on the outside - say the infighting has infected the campaign's day-to-day operations, with little communication and mounting distrust among Manafort, Lewandowski, and their ""It's a total cage fight in there now,"" said an operative close to the ""Manafort tried to take out Corey, but he didn't And now, everywhere Corey looks, he sees a threat, so he's trying to neutralize those "" Supporters and opponents of Lewandowski say he and his allies have called Trump's attention to articles chronicling lobbying work done by Manafort or his campaign associates for a gambling company, as well as politically problematic foreign clients, including Saudi Arabia, multiple pro-Russian figures and a group accused of being a front for Pakistani An ally of Manafort's said Lewandowski ""takes all the bad news up to Trump - 'Paul represented this person, Paul represented that ' "" Lewandowski and Manafort declined to comment, as did the Trump campaign's press But even as a Tuesday news report revealed that Trump was separating the rival factions into distant office spaces in his New York headquarters, a campaign official disputed the characterization of an increasingly bitter and damaging divide, asserting that the once-skeletal campaign of the billionaire real estate developer had moved past the well-documented acrimony in its upper ""Corey and Paul are actually working very well together right There is a very clear delineation of roles and responsibilities right now, and things are better than they have ever been,"" the official said, suggesting that any efforts to undermine Manafort or Lewandowski reflected only the actions of lower-level individuals acting on their Indeed, most of the dirty work on both sides of the tug-of-war has been conducted not by the principals, but by their supporters in and around the For instance, a California Republican close to the campaign said Lewandowski has repeatedly tried to enlist allies on the campaign in his efforts to marginalize ""He's going to people and saying, 'I need your We need to get rid of Paul,' "" said the Lewandowski's supporters inside the campaign have highlighted accounts of Manafort privately assuring leery Republican officials that Trump will moderate his tone in the general election and act more presidential, according to people close to the Those reports have bothered the first-time candidate, who has bristled at efforts to restrain the bombastic rhetoric that helped fuel his Manafort seems acutely aware of the sensitivity of the terrain, and he pushed back after POLITICO on Friday reported that he told top GOP congressional officials that his boss' ""behavior can be "" Manafort argued later that he was not referring to Trump's behavior, but his poll numbers, explaining his ""negatives are going to be changing over the course of the next couple of weeks, as Republicans come "" Meanwhile, Lewandowski for months has been the target of whisper campaigns from a pair of erstwhile Trump campaign advisers with whom he had clashed well before Manafort came on board in March - veteran GOP operative Roger Stone and former Stone protégé Sam Last week, Nunberg helped facilitate a New York Post Page Six item about an argument between Lewandowski and campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks on a Manhattan sidewalk outside the Trump campaign headquarters, according to a person with direct knowledge of how the item made its way onto the Post's The person said that Nunberg asked an associate to relay information about the exchange to the Post, which relied on a witness who quoted Hicks screaming at Lewandowski, ""I am done with you!"" Hicks declined to comment for this story, as did Trump campaign adviser Michael Caputo, another former Stone protégé who witnessed the incident, according to two Stone said he had ""nothing to do with"" the planting of the item and is ""not responsible about anything Sam says or "" He acknowledged emailing the Page Six item to some of his associates after it posted, but suggested that was in service of ""It didn't reflect well on the candidate,"" Stone ""I don't like anything that's harmful to Donald's "" Nunberg would not comment on whether he had a role in the Page Six item, but he suggested Trump would be well-served by firing ""Donald loves to fire Why can't he just say it to Corey?"" said Nunberg, who blamed Lewandowski for his own firing from the campaign last summer over a years-old racist Facebook The Trump campaign official sought to distance Manafort and the campaign as a whole from Stone and Nunberg, declaring ""there's no association with Roger or Sam and anyone on the "" After Nunberg was fired from Trump's campaign, he endorsed Trump's now-vanquished GOP rival Ted Cruz, and doesn't speak to the billionaire That's not the case for The self-styled dirty trickster - who also has advocated conspiracy theories including that Lyndon Johnson was a leader in the plot to murder John Kennedy - worked with Manafort for years as partners in a lobbying firm and also advised Trump for years before the Stone emphasizes that he has no formal role with the But he has fashioned a role for himself as an informal adviser and high-profile He has waged a months-long campaign to boost Trump and Manafort, while eviscerating perceived enemies, including Lewandowski, using social media, television and radio appearances and his own writing on conservative On his expletive-filled Twitter feed, Stone has publicly branded Trump's campaign manager "" "" He's urged Trump to question Lewandowski's loyalty, calling him a ""snake"" and comparing him to the serpentine villain in a song Trump recites on the stump about a woman who is killed by a snake she had Stone also has used Twitter to lash out at Barry Bennett, a Lewandowski ally on the campaign, as ""brainless,"" and ""ignorant, unpresentable and inarticulate,"" while urging him to ""stay out of the You hurt Trump every time you open your "" Bennett, a senior adviser to the Trump campaign, wouldn't respond to Stone's jabs, but suggested his public vitriol is not helping ""I have nothing bad to say about anyone who is working to elect Donald Trump,"" Bennett ""I don't understand why anyone would think attacking a member of the team moves the ball "" When news broke last week that Trump had promoted Manafort to campaign chairman and chief strategist, Stone took to Twitter to gloat, calling it a ""good decision"" and mocking Lewandowski, urging him to ""call your "" But a source with knowledge of the situation said that Manafort's allies had leaked the report of Manafort's promotion to counteract a recent New York Times Magazine article that focused much more attention on Lewandowski's role on the Trump Stone tweeted that Manafort's promotion made the nearly 7,000-word story ""hopelessly "" The target list in Stone's crusade against Lewandowski also has come to include journalists he views as insufficiently skeptical of the campaign manager's importance or performance, or overly skeptical of Manafort's - a group that includes reporters at POLITICO and The Washington When the Post reported that Lewandowski had been tapped to head Trump's vice presidential selection process, Stone accused Bennett of being an anonymous source for the story and assailed it as ""100 % "" (Bennett declined to comment on whether he played any role in the ) Stone repeatedly demanded a retraction and launched into a weeks-long crusade against the reporter who wrote it, accusing him of being ""conned"" and ""Neither [the reporter] or Corey Lewandowski knows his ass from his elbow,"" Stone tweeted, demanding that the reporter ""resign or be fired for his false reporting,"" and suggesting that Stone intended to ""chat with his editor this "" The Post declined to In an interview this month with popular libertarian talk-show host Alex Jones, Stone argued that Lewandowski ""has aggrandized his role"" partly by leaking the vice presidential selection story, before pivoting to an ironic plea for unity on the Trump ""Campaigns that are divided will lose,"" Stone ""Now Donald Trump is smart enough to know that open discord in his campaign is not But it is very clear that some in the entourage are more interested in feathering their own nest . . . while others, who are consummate political professionals like Paul Manafort are keeping their head down, not playing the press game to try to burnish their own standing and their own image, but focusing on getting Donald Trump elected "" Hadas Gold contibuted to this To view online: To change your alert settings, please go to or email was sent to user@domain by: POLITICO, LLC 1000 Wilson Arlington, VA, 22209, USA To unsubscribe,",0

"Keith, The attachment is in WORD and better Brian Dear Keith, Enclosed please find my comments on Jean Grove's It gives the impression of a cut and paste job written in haste with several minor annoying It lacks the synthesis I would have expected and reads like a The paper is also not as comprehensive as would appear from the Six months ago I reviewed a paper by her ( for Astrid) on ""The Initiation of the Little Ice Age in regions round the North Atlantic"". The paper she submitted to you is clearly complementary and reviews "" the rest of the world"" for comparison with the classic areas discussed in the earlier Yet the earlier paper is only alluded to once (rather coyly) and does not appear in the This surely has to be significantly recognised in the title and body of this paper, because as it stands, the review of this earlier (best dated) material is far from I cannot speak for most of these data directly but the North American material I am familiar with is not particularly up to date (though in fairness most of Greg Wiles's stuff is still in press). I have sent her under separate cover copies of my Little Ice Age in the Rockies paper (about 6 months ago) and more recently the Luckman and Villalba review paper on glacier fluctuations of the last Millennium along the PEP-1 (copies are on their way to you too). I think her mixing the discussion of ice core records and glacier histories significantly muddies the waters on whether the term LIA should be used to refer to a glacier or a climate I feel this should be addressed and the paper needs a more effective She must also decide whether she wants diagrams or I don't know how she will take these criticisms but, as she is just finishing revising the book, I would have thought she could have presented a better I leave it to your judgement as to how to deal with these The paper could be much better but that depends on how much she is willing to reorganise and to some extent rethink what she has I am sending you this Do you want me to return the manuscript to you? If you wish I can also e-mail WORD copies of the two papers to you ( and her) if you wish a rapid But you will only get the diagrams by If I don't hear from you tomorrow I'll just put everything in the Cheers Brian Review of ""The Initiation of the Little Ice Age"" by Jean Grove This paper is a useful summary but needs significant fine-tuning and possibly retitling before it should be The title promises a comprehensive review that the text does not When I first read this paper I kept asking myself- where is the discussion of all the well-dated early LIA material from Switzerland, Canada and Alaska? Then I remembered the paper by the author that I reviewed 6 months ago entitled ""The Initiation of the Little Ice Age in Regions round the North Atlantic"". The present paper is not a global review of evidence but a companion paper that compares the ""Rest of the World"" with the ""European/North Atlantic record"" discussed in that earlier The crux of the problem is the first sentence after the title ""Little Ice Age Initiation "" at the top of page I initially read this to mean that Holzhauser had submitted a paper on the European record to Climatic Careful re-reading suggests that the author is actually referring to her own review This misunderstanding could be avoided by explicitly acknowledging, in the introduction to the present paper, that the evidence for the circum North Atlantic Region has previously been reviewed by Grove ( in press), giving the full citation in the references, and that the section entitled ""LIA initiation in regions around the North Atlantic"" is a brief summary of that There are a number of general points that need to be made before discussing This discussion begs the question of how one would recognise the beginning of the LIA (A question I raised in my earlier review) Why, for example is the line drawn between the 8-9th century medieval glacier advances and the 12-13th century ones? Possibly this is related to the author's definition of the so-called Medieval Warm Period which has recently been extensively discussed (Hughes and Diaz 1994). It might be useful to insert a brief discussion of the rationale for this boundary and a definition and defence of the use of the term Medieval Warm either the introduction or the final discussion I also feel that there is a logical inconsistency in the way the author uses the ice core evidence in this In her abstract Dr Grove indicates that ""the term LIA refers to the behaviour of glaciers, not directly to the climatic circumstances causing them to expand "" (abstract lines 3-4). I agree strongly agree with this usage to differentiate between a glacier event and a climatic However, the discussion of the definition of the LIA from the ice core work is based on either periods of greater annual snow accumulation or inferred paleotemperatures from isotopic these definitions are based on climatic events not glacial The author should perhaps address this dichotomy and discuss it more If one wishes to argue for retaining the term LIA for the glacial event, it is inconsistent to identify it in ice core records based on temperature (or snowfall ) The author appears to have an implicit faith in the veracity of 14C dates which I do not share and a disdain for minimum age dating based on lichenometry or There is a strong emphasis on calendar dated 14C ages throughout this paper and age determinations by other techniques are often significantly The paper never specifically addresses the relative errors involved in age determinations by these various Lichenometry and minimum age tree-ring dating of moraines are disparaged yet, in this timeframe the error terms are almost certainly less than 14C dates from equivalent situations ( dates above glacier deposits or on moraine surfaces). The comments made in this paper about lichenometric dating and dendrochronological dating of moraines (from minimum tree ages) only stress the likelyhood of large errors through the use of these dating These comments may be appropriate for some moraines that date from the 12-13th centuries but they should not be unqualified, universal statements cannot remain couched in those In most situations lichen and tree-ring minimum ages for moraines of the last 500 years or so are considerably more accurate than 14C ages would In my review of her earlier paper I commented that I did not consider that sites in the Canadian Rockies could be described as ""around the North Atlantic"". In this paper, it makes no geographical sense to review the results from the Rockies separately from adjacent areas in British Columbia and Alaska which they closely resemble (see Luckman and Villalba, in press). I have no objection to the comment that the Rockies material was discussed in a previous paper (and will therefore not be repeated in detail) but surely in the context of this paper these results should be presented in the discussion of evidence from Western North Having recently reviewed the literature for North America I also note there are omissions of significant recent material that is recently published or in press (see Luckman and Villalba attached). The Tables and diagrams appear identical except for Table Tables 1-9 should be deleted? More detailed and specific comments Page Para Line 1 3 4 why is lichenometry excluded? 1 4 1 Reference to Grove in press?? 1 4 In this paper evidence 2 2 1-2 Is dating within the last millennium considered to be the critical defining factor in identifying a glacier advance as belonging to the LIA?

This section on Alaska is quite dated (see Luckman and Villalba and several references by Wiles and Calkin cited therein). 16 2 This section needs to be The data presented for Klinakini Glacier and Franklin Glaciers are presented and then queried without reaching any Both indicate glacier advance after the dated materials and the comments qualifying these dates apply equally well to many other dates cited in this (Lag time is ignored at several other sites in the discussion). The reporting of the Bridge Glacier site is Ryder and Thomson only identify one advance here, not two and consider both 14C ages provide limiting dates for the same The till described is between the paleosol and the present surface not between two Although scattered, there are several other papers on this region- Ryder 1987, Desloges and Ryder 1990, Clague and Mathews, 1992 etc - see Luckman and Villalba, in press). 16 As stated earlier, discussion of the Canadian Rockies should be included with western North There are also early LIA moraines on Mount Baker in 18 1 Rothlisberger and 19 1 1-2 Rationale for this statement? 20 1 1-2 See earlier The ice core data provide information about snow accumulation and climate- not necessarily glacier advances 20 1 end in-situ trees at what site? Again Thompson is referring to a climate event not a glacial event 20 Footnote 13 Based on what data? 1970 predates the 1976 Pacific Climate 21 2 13-14 Again, is this bias? In my experience dating based on the oldest tree for most moraines has far smaller error terms than radiocarbon In this specific case the moraine may be older but this does not justify the statement ""approximate at best"" 21 2 20 why is Rothlisberger's date of 1000-1220 cal AD acceptable in this circumstance but Ryder and Thomson's date of 1040-1210 ( p16) not? 24 footnote 14 although the survey may have delimited glacier area, I assume it was an aerial survey !! 24 3 1 sub-fossil 24 3 5 see comment on 21 2 20 24 3 8 14C dates do not sample! Sample taken from a 26 footnote 16 see Gordon and Harkness, 1992 Quat Sci Rev, 11 697-709 for a comprehensive review 28 2 see earlier comments on ice core 28 3 4-5 what specifically is meant here? Warmer and cooler intervals for which dates? 29 2 5-6 see Lack of obvious period of significantly cooler temperatures? 30 2 1-2 But you don't present any ""precise dates"" in this table, nor are any of the calendar dendro dates from Alaska included . If this table is intended to be a summary should not it show all of the data being discussed? 31 1 3-4 The implication here seems to be that a 14C date from an in-situ log gives a more precise limiting date for the subsequent glacier event than date from a log that is not in-situ? Is this the case? Or is it that dates on wood are better calibrated than dates on soils, bones or other 32 1 4 Luckman 1995 I 32 1 10-11 These are not dates from moraines but dates from forests overridden by glacier Are there any examples of moraines dated to the 13th century presented in this Table 10 is never referred to in the It needs a Does 13 th century or 1300s? 33 1 1-3 decreased temperatures or increased accumulation correlated with the LIA have been identified in these This is not a very synthetic 34 Barlow et , 1997 delete in press 35 Bjork Antarctic 36 Corte CONICET not CONISET 36 Eglington Font 36 Fushimi Initials 36 Fuhimi 1978 delete reference to 1977! 37 include Grove in press 38 Holzhauser 1998?? 39 Luckman 1993a should be Luckman , Holdsworth, G and Osborn , 1993 reorder Luckman 1993b as Luckman 1993 40 Luckman 1996b Dendroglaciology not Dendrochronology Alberta not British Columbia 41 Nesje and Dahl 1991b delete ) Nesje et , Jostedalsbreen ???

They want to run it in early May I think and I have been told I will see their edited draft on my The idea was to make a wider comment that just report on your latest curve so I decided to mention uncertainties in tree-ring data while pushing the need for more work on high-resolution proxies and especially interpretive work in the very recent context of high temperatures and other possible anthropogenic environmental The trouble is that they would only give us 1000 words and one Anyway this Figure now contains a selection of various large-scale temperature average series - all recalibrated against northern warm season (april-sept) average land data north of 20 degrees This is just to provide a convenient common scale - all the original season /area references are You will see that this brings phil's curve nicely back in line and the correct (low frequency ) density curve now fits better I have taken the opportunity to put our new longish (2000-year)tree-ring width curve in representing the north of Europe/Siberia . This is the average of Tornetrask(Sweden) and Yamal and Taimyr(Siberia ) - all processed to retain low-frequency These curves and a similar average incorporating all the Northern tree-ring data (not including the large density set) are in my paper for the Pages open science meeting Tim and I will produce a short paper describing the new low-frequency density curve , probably for Geophysical Research For the meantime I hope you think the perspectives piece is Let me know if you have any problems with it - but remember that they are going to hack it about By the way, how did you compare the high-elevation (PC1) timeseries with Jacoby and D'Arrigo's northern treeline data in your paper when the latter only go back to 1671 ?

Fortunately, these two are clowns, neither remotely as sharp as Lindzen or as slick as Michaels, and it wasn't too difficult to deal with Suffice it to say, the event did not go the way Inhofe and the republicans had The democrats, conveniently, had received word of Hans' resignation, but the republicans and Soon/Legates had So when, quite fittingly, Jim Jeffords (you may remember--he's the senator who was in the news a couple years ago for tilting the balance of power back to the democrats when he left the republican party in protest) hit them with this news at the hearing, they were caught completely off The ""Wall Street Journal"" article you cited was icing on the Inhofe, who rails against the liberal media, will have a difficult time doing so against the WSJ!

"Trump's empty administration By Darren Samuelsohn and Ben White 05/09/2016 05:21 AM EDT Top Republican political leaders aren't the only ones shunning their party's presidential nominee - a vast number of highly skilled managers and policy experts, veterans of recent GOP administrations who would normally be expected to fill key positions for a new White House, are also vowing to sit out a Donald Trump And while the failure of the two Presidents Bush or House Speaker Paul Ryan to endorse the presumptive nominee carries political consequences, the absence of policy veterans in a new administration would have a substantive effect on the running of Politico interviewed nearly five dozen Republicans over the past two weeks - people with experience working in government and who understand how Congress can enact, or shred, a new president's agenda - and heard the same sentiment expressed If Trump doesn't change his tune or extend much longer olive branches, many of these government veterans say they intend to cede highly coveted administration posts to less-experienced ""I would never serve in a Trump administration,"" said James Capretta, a former Office of Management and Budget official under George ""The person at the top is unfit for the He's made that very clear with his "" Added Matt McDonald, another Bush OMB veteran: ""I wouldn't vote for Trump, much less work for I don't agree with half his ideas, and the other half I don't really believe what he "" One former Republican official who worked in the Environmental Protection Agency put it this way: ""You'd have to worry about your future career and the way you're perceived in these You just kind of think of how he deals with Would you really want to work for him?"" The lack of interest in serving Trump extends from the energy and financial services sectors to defense and foreign And while the reluctance of former officials to join a Trump administration may spark a good-riddance response from the candidate himself, the absence of experienced professionals at the assistant-secretary level could have profound consequences on the ""The bottom line is Trump will be able to fill these jobs because there is a whole class of people who want these titles so badly it doesn't matter who is president,"" said a former senior George Bush administration ""But these are B- or C-level They are honorable, but not very The A-level people, and there are not that many of them to begin with, mostly don't want to work for He will cut the A-level bench of available policy talent at least in half, if not "" Building an administration from scratch requires filling more than 3,000 high-level federal jobs, starting with a Cabinet and trickling down to the scores of deputies, undersecretaries and assistant administrators who actually make the government It's a herculean task for any new president, but would, perhaps, especially be so for Trump, who has taken anti-Washington campaigning to new This makes Trump's challenge of uniting the Republican Party urgent - and The current and former lawmakers, former GOP administration officials, policy experts and presidential transition veterans who spoke with Politico agreed that Trump will need to display a much more serious level of policy understanding and statesmanship over the next six months to demonstrate he's the kind of boss they would really want to work As he's cemented his role as the GOP's presumptive nominee, Trump has taken initial steps toward building a White House transition plan: The New York Times reported on Friday that Trump had put his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, in charge of a team that would include campaign manager Corey Lewandowski and senior adviser Paul Trump campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks, who did not respond to requests for comment for this story, told the Times that leaders of their transition team would be announced ""in the coming "" Several Republican issue experts confirmed they've also recently started helping the campaign build out its knowledge base and outreach to the party's policy experts, working in tandem with Jeff Sessions ( ), the first senator to endorse For example, John Mashburn, a former chief of staff to Thom Tillis ( ), just started with the Trump campaign as policy director, joining longtime Sessions aide Stephen Miller, another senior policy But Trump's initial steps to get ready to govern don't compare with where Republicans were four years ago on the transition By the late spring of 2012, Mitt Romney was already starting to vet possible Cabinet members, as well as people willing to serve in other senior political Even Marco Rubio and Jeb Bush in the early stages of the 2016 race were collecting the names of potential administration On Friday, President Barack Obama signed an executive order that launches his end of the transition process, including briefings on certain issues for the presidential It's a move that follows up on a law he signed in March that requires a sitting administration to begin planning the hand-over to a new administration six months before the November Former Utah Mike Leavitt, whose personal advocacy on the transition planning issue led Congress to name the new law in part after him, wrote in an email that this year's presidential nominees must start planning, too, given there are less than 75 days between the election and ""This is not a political thing,"" said Leavitt, who handled Romney's 2012 transition planning and served under George Bush as an EPA administrator and also secretary at the Department of Health and Human ""It's a serious "" A source familiar with Trump's thinking explained that the billionaire businessman was reluctant to add new layers of policy experts now, feeling it would only muddy his populist message that has been hyperfocused on illegal immigration, trade and fighting Islamic ""He doesn't want to waste time on policy and thinks it would make him less effective on the stump,"" the Trump source ""It won't be until after he is elected but before he's inaugurated that he will figure out exactly what he is going to do and who he is going to try to "" Trump said as much in a recent interview with The New York Times, telling the newspaper he is thinking about his potential appointments to be ambassador to the United Nations and secretaries of Defense and ""But I think more about winning first,"" he As he considers who he'd want on his team, the Manhattan billionaire has spoken about following in the footsteps of Abraham Lincoln by tapping some of his 2016 Republican rivals - from Chris Christie and Ben Carson to Marco Rubio and John Kasich - as Cabinet members, or even for a running In an interview with CNN last week, Trump said he may put Carson and Christie on a committee to vet possible vice presidents and other administration But even people who have been mentioned by the candidate himself as potential hires are reluctant to engage in a discussion of whether they would want to serve in his Rubio, for example, sidestepped several questions in late April about life in a possible Trump administration, either for himself or any other ""I've not thought about it and I don't have a thoughtful answer,"" he told ""I just haven't spent any time thinking about what you're asking "" At Treasury, which plays a lead role on fiscal and tax policy, the only candidate regularly mentioned by Trump is long-time Wall Street activist investor Carl But the 80-year-old Icahn has repeatedly said he doesn't want the And few who follow these jobs closely think Trump would even try to persuade ""You can't send an 80-year-old Wall Street guy to be Treasury secretary,"" one top former Republican White House official ""It's not going to be Carl You can have an old Wall Street guy as trade representative or at Commerce or something but not It doesn't "" Trump could still look to Wall Street for a Treasury secretary, perhaps from the private equity A name often mentioned to replace Jack Lew is Blackstone Group Chief Executive Stephen Schwarzman; a person close to Schwarzman described him as a ""great choice"" for Trump has also mentioned KKR co-founder and co-CEO Henry Kravis as a possible Treasury But Kravis, 72, has said he's not Trump also name-dropped former GE CEO Jack Welch, 80, for Welch has also said he does not want the Tennessee Bob Corker, who has worked extensively on financial issues including reforming the housing finance system, has also been mentioned for Treasury as well as for secretary of One other name mentioned by several Republicans as a possible Trump Treasury secretary is Glenn Hubbard, currently dean of the Columbia organization Graduate School of Hubbard served in top economic jobs in both Bush He advised Jeb Bush before the former Florida governor dropped out of the 2016 Trump would certainly not be Hubbard's first choice of presidents to serve, people who know him But he might agree if implored by Trump to help run economic policy including a big tax rewrite, Hubbard's top Hubbard did not respond to a request for Trump's biggest challenge in attracting talent, however, is Trump himself, according to dozens of Republican policy The real estate billionaire has run a presidential campaign heavy on insults and devoid of the kinds of substantive policy ideas that GOP issue experts look to for signs of what they'd be working on if they joined his ""I think it would be very hard to help him,"" said presidential historian Stephen Hess, a former aide to Presidents Dwight Eisenhower and Richard ""He of all the candidates I have ever known is the most profoundly ignorant of the I don't know quite how you deal with that once you get to the point when you are supposed to be advising "" Sure enough, the same motivations behind the #NeverTrump movement that has been working to block the billionaire's path to the GOP nomination also apply to many of the Republican policy wonks who have no plans to ever send Trump their résumé After Trump became the presumptive nominee with his victory in Indiana last Tuesday, Keith Hennessey, who led George Bush's National Economic Council, turned to Twitter to repost a link to a recent blog post that declared his firm opposition, complete with a lengthy takedown of the billionaire's evolving policy ""This is not a tough call,"" Hennessey wrote in ""Donald Trump is an ignorant, unprincipled, amoral policy lightweight opposed to free market capitalism and limited "" Trump's personnel challenges also threaten to undermine some of the most ambitious parts of his Several officials who served in George Bush's Treasury Department and at the Federal Reserve during the most recent GOP administration predicted a President Trump would have trouble attracting A-list talent to help him execute a plan to completely rewrite an uncompetitive corporate tax code while also addressing a national debt nearing $20 ""Not only will I not work for Trump, I'll continue to use my voice to actively oppose Trump isn't merely distasteful or wrong on policy - he's a danger to the country,"" said Tony Fratto a former White House and Treasury official under George ""He is truly Anyone who thinks he's going to 'moderate' or become reasonable once he achieves power is "" Lanhee Chen, who served as Romney's 2012 policy director and then took on a senior advising role with Rubio in 2016, declined to comment when asked about his willingness to serve under But he did admit that Trump faces an uphill climb attracting experienced ""My view is it would be very challenging for a lot of mainstream policy folks to envision working in an administration for somebody who has said some of the things Trump has said during the campaign,"" Chen While other Republicans who might serve in senior economic and financial regulatory posts said they would have no interest in joining a Trump administration, some did concede they might take the chance in part out of a sense of duty to try and keep Trump from doing any real ""I think over time he will be able to fill those jobs, but it will not be easy at the start,"" said one senior Republican who has been mentioned for at least two Cabinet ""He will have to surround himself with people who know what they are And in a way it may be a great opportunity for people who really want to make a difference, because he's going to come in without a set of people already around him or any strong preconceived notions of what to "" Liza Wright, who ran the Bush White House's personnel shop from 2005 to 2007, said she expects the number of Republican policy experts willing to work for Trump to grow if the party establishment rallies around ""I think personal ambition is going to overcome a lot of angst and principle over whether they fundamentally support Trump,"" Wright ""I've seen that a lot, where people want that bullet point on a résumé."" But there's still the question of whether Trump would want to surround himself with veterans of past The presumptive nominee is just as dismissive of recognized policy-area experts as they are of During a foreign policy address last month in Washington, Trump signaled he had little interest in many of the Bush administration veterans who have been busy during the Obama era making money at law firms, on K Street and in academia since leaving their government jobs, many more than a decade ""We have to look to new people because many of the old people frankly don't know what they're doing, even though they may look awfully good writing in The New York Times or being watched on television,"" Trump And certainly, if Trump takes over the White House in January 2017, he will hire enough people to keep agencies Indeed, as he shifts toward the general election and alters his GOP-primary-focused rhetoric, the party establishment's animosity toward its standard-bearer could ""There's no doubt in my mind that people will be sending résumés in,"" said Tom Marino, a Pennsylvania Republican and early Trump supporter on Capitol Hill who predicted the frenzy for administration jobs would kick in in earnest at the conclusion of the 2016 ""Talking to people who know people, it will Things change after the "" Some of the elected GOP officials who have endorsed the billionaire's campaign said they would consider joining the administration, even if it meant leaving their Capitol Hill California GOP Duncan Hunter, a former Marine officer in Afghanistan and Iraq, wouldn't rule out working at a Trump-led ""We'll see,"" he said in an ""I'm only "" ""Of course I'd be interested,"" replied North Dakota Kevin Cramer, who endorsed Trump in April and was mentioned in a recent story in The Hill as a possible energy ""Would I love to shape a team? Yes, I'd love "" George David Banks, a former George Bush environmental aide who served at the White House and State Department, also raised his hand signaling a willingness to serve his party's presumptive ""I would be honored to work for a Trump White House,"" he said, adding that he expected to see many of his GOP colleagues lobby for administration jobs if the Republican wins the general ""But the real question is how many of them would Trump actually "" Indeed, many of Trump's allies insist he will have no problem finding enough people to work for him in government; the only question will be weeding out the predictable candidates and choosing the best people to do the ""There are people who make a career out of glomming on or latching on to whoever it is in power,"" Hunter ""Those people will try to latch on as soon as possible to whoever they think is going to "" Bryan Bender and Eli Stokols contributed to this To view online: To change your alert settings, please go to or email was sent to user@domain by: POLITICO, LLC 1000 Wilson Arlington, VA, 22209, USA To unsubscribe,",0
